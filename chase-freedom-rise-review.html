This is partly because it doesn't require a cash deposit, earns cash back rewards, and has no annual fee. Perhaps more importantly, the Chase Freedom Rise® helps build credit over time by reporting monthly to the three credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.</p><p>The Chase Freedom Rise® also helps users break into the Chase universe of credit and banking products, which gives cardholders the option to upgrade to a Chase credit card with <a href=# rel=alternate>more robust rewards</a> after building credit.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-card-for>Who is the card for?</h2><p>The Chase Freedom Rise® is for individuals with no credit history who are looking for a first credit card.</p><p>One of its most notable features is that it's a “credit-building" card—but it’s not for repairing bad credit. This differentiates it from <a href=# rel=alternate>secured credit cards</a>, which let users work toward rebuilding their credit after mistakes but require a security deposit.</p><p>Approval odds for this card increase when someone has a Chase checking account with at least $250 on deposit, so you may need to to start banking with Chase.</p><p>This card also has <a href=# rel=alternate>variable interest rates on the higher end</a>—which can take those new to credit cards by surprise.</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons>Pros and cons</h2><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Available with no credit score.</li><li>No security deposit required.</li><li>Earns rewards.</li><li>No annual fee.</li><li>Reports to the credit bureaus.</li><li>Path to higher credit limits.</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>High and variable APR.</li><li>Charges 3% foreign transaction fees.</li><li>May need a Chase checking account to be approved.</li><li>Not designed for rebuilding bad credit.</li></ul><h2 id=rewards-structure>Rewards structure</h2><p>The Chase Freedom Rise® offers a very respectable rewards rate of 1.5% cash back on all purchases. This puts it on par with cards geared to consumers with good or excellent credit, including the <a href=# rel=alternate>Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card</a>. The card also earns 5% cash back on Lyft rides through March 31, 2025.</p><p>Cash back rewards never expire as long as the account remains open and in good standing. They can be redeemed anytime.</p><p>Don’t want cash back? Cardholders can redeem rewards for gift cards, Amazon purchases, or travel through the Chase portal.</p><p>Chase Freedom Rise® also offers a $25 cash bonus when you set up automatic payments.</p><h2 id=the-fine-print>The fine print</h2><p>This card’s terms are fairly straightforward—other than Chase checking account holders gaining increased approval odds. Still, be aware that this card has <a href=# rel=alternate>variable interest rates on the high side</a>—which means <a href=# rel=alternate>the annual percentage rate (APR) can change periodically</a>. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Here’s a breakdown of fees and charges</a>:</p><h3>Interest rates</h3><ul><li><strong>Regular APR</strong>: 26.99% (Variable).</li><li><strong>Balance transfer</strong>: 26.99% (Variable).</li><li><strong>Cash advance APR</strong>: 29.99%</li><li><strong>Penalty</strong>: Up to 29.99% (Variable).</li></ul><h3>Fees</h3><ul><li><strong>Annual fee</strong>: $0.</li><li><strong>Balance transfer fee</strong>: 5% of each transfer ($5 minimum).</li><li><strong>Cash advance fee</strong>: 5% of each cash advance ($10 minimum).</li><li><strong>Foreign transaction fee</strong>: 3% of each transaction in U.S. dollars.</li><li><strong>Late payment fee</strong>: Up to $40.</li><li><strong>Returned payment fee</strong>: Up to $40.</li><li><strong>Over the credit limit fee</strong>: $0.</li><li><strong>Returned check fee</strong>: $0.</li></ul><h2 id=hidden-perks>Hidden perks</h2><p>This card offers <a href=# rel=nofollow>quite a few benefits</a> that might surprise you, most notably, consumer protections. Here's a <a href=# rel=nofollow>rundown:</a></p><ul><li><strong>DoorDash</strong>: A three-month complimentary DashPass membership, with $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees (activation required).</li><li><strong>Extended warranties</strong>: Extra protection on items with a manufacturer's warranty of three years or less.</li><li><strong>Purchase protection</strong>: Coverage for 120 days, worth up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account.</li><li><strong>Trip cancellation and interruption insurance</strong>: Coverage up to $1,500 per person and $6,000 per trip. Must be used for eligible, prepaid travel expenses, and the trip must be canceled or cut short for a covered reason.</li></ul><h2 id=where-does-the-card-stand-out>Where does the card stand out?</h2><p>This credit-building card stands out compared to others with easy credit qualifications.</p><h3>No credit history required</h3><p>The biggest benefit of this card: It's available to people with no credit history at all. You can use this card to start building credit from scratch, and you can even increase your approval odds by opening an eligible account with Chase.</p><h3>Cash-back rewards for spending</h3><p>Earning 1.5% cash back on all purchases is rare with no credit history. This card's rewards rate is competitive with some of the best credit cards on the market today, especially since there's no annual fee.</p><h2 id=what-could-be-improved>What could be improved?</h2><p>One of the biggest potential downsides: You may need a Chase checking account to be approved. These <a href=# rel=nofollow>checking accounts have monthly service fees</a> unless you meet steep direct deposit requirements, or maintain relatively large amounts in an account or across multiple accounts ($1,500 to $5,000, or more).</p><p>In practice, however, this may not be a hurdle for many customers without credit history. That’s because Chase offers a free checking account for five years <a href=# rel=nofollow>for college students</a> aged 17 to 24.</p><p>Another drawback is that the Chase Freedom Rise® charges 3% in foreign transaction fees. That makes this card a poor option for traveling abroad.</p><p>Finally, it's important to remember that the Chase Freedom Rise® is not designed for credit rebuilding. Having no credit history is not a barrier, but you are unlikely to be approved if you have poor or fair credit due to late payments or other negative credit history.</p><h2 id=card-alternatives>Card alternatives</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=28><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Annual fee</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Rise(SM)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*5048356*,*field*:*annual_fees*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fees</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Capital One(R) QuicksilverOne(R) Cash Rewards Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006160*,*field*:*annual_fees*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fees</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Credit score needed</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Rise(SM)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*5048356*,*field*:*credit_score_needed*,*api*:*cc*}>credit_score_needed</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Capital One(R) QuicksilverOne(R) Cash Rewards Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006160*,*field*:*credit_score_needed*,*api*:*cc*}>credit_score_needed</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Fair, Poor, Bad</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=6><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Cash back rewards</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>1.5% cash back on all purchases</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>1.5% cash back on all purchases</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>2% to 10% cash back (select merchants only)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom line</h2><p>The Chase Freedom Rise® is unbeatable for building credit if you have no history.
