Sharing a&nbsp;family recipe can help build relationships, but it&nbsp;also comes with responsibility. So&nbsp;it’s understandable why a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit user</a> had a&nbsp;few reservations about telling her boyfriend’s mom a&nbsp;secret recipe.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;woman got into an&nbsp;argument after refusing to&nbsp;share her family recipe.</h2></p><p>My&nbsp;boyfriend Nick and&nbsp;I have been dating for 3&nbsp;years, almost 4&nbsp;now. Before this incident&nbsp;I got along great with his family. I&nbsp;was invited to&nbsp;spend holidays with them, and we&nbsp;exchanged gifts on&nbsp;birthdays, so&nbsp;I thought we&nbsp;were pretty close.</p><p>Every year Nick’s family goes on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip, this summer the trip was to&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;I really wanted to&nbsp;go. I&nbsp;asked his mom, who was planning the trip, if&nbsp;I could tag along if&nbsp;I paid for myself. She said sorry&nbsp;no, but this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family trip, and&nbsp;I wasn’t family yet. I&nbsp;told Nick, and he&nbsp;said no&nbsp;one’s s/o was invited, so&nbsp;I wasn’t the only one being excluded. I&nbsp;was still upset but dropped the subject.</p><p>It’s now fall, and the weather is&nbsp;getting cooler. Nick’s family was coming over, so&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;family’s chili recipe to&nbsp;celebrate the cold weather. Nick and his family love my&nbsp;chili, so&nbsp;I made sure there was enough for them to&nbsp;take home. Before Nick’s mom left she asked if&nbsp;I could share the recipe with her, so&nbsp;she could make it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;work potluck. I&nbsp;told her sorry, but this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret family recipe. She asked aren’t we&nbsp;already considered family. I&nbsp;replied according to&nbsp;you, we&nbsp;aren’t. After that she went “oh&nbsp;ok” then left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ea/bc9/e2022350ce9c2ad81042974c5d.jpg><p>After everyone was gone Nick told me&nbsp;I was being cruel. I&nbsp;reminded him that his mother was the one who said&nbsp;I wasn’t family first, and she can’t pick and choose when we&nbsp;are. He&nbsp;said that was a&nbsp;completely different situation, and&nbsp;I was being petty. He&nbsp;left after that and has been cold to&nbsp;me&nbsp;for the past couple of&nbsp;days. I&nbsp;don’t see how I’m in&nbsp;the wrong here, it’s ok&nbsp;for his mother to&nbsp;deny me&nbsp;something because we’re not family but when I&nbsp;do it&nbsp;I’m wrong?</p><p><h2>Later, the poster came with an&nbsp;update.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;talk with Nick and his mom. I&nbsp;explained how after all we’ve been through hearing her say I’m not family to&nbsp;my&nbsp;face hurt. And it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;feel even worse when she only considered me&nbsp;family when she wanted something from&nbsp;me. His mom apologized and said she didn’t mean for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;come out that way. She was trying to&nbsp;say the trip is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;reward for marriage or&nbsp;an&nbsp;official welcome gift.</p><p>Nick apologized too saying he&nbsp;didn’t know what his mom told&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;thought she just told me&nbsp;I couldn’t come not and that she didn’t consider me&nbsp;family. He&nbsp;admitted that seeing his mom sad overridden the rational part of&nbsp;his brain which is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;didn’t stop to&nbsp;think and immediately reacted in&nbsp;anger. Although we&nbsp;talked it&nbsp;out Nick and his mom are walking on&nbsp;eggshells around&nbsp;me, not sure if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;better than them giving me&nbsp;the cold shoulder though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/429/1b1/91cab45839a1bef87c88e64d5c.jpg><p><h2>There was overwhelming support for the unnamed woman coming from her fellow Redditors.</h2></p><ul><li>“’That was a&nbsp;completely different situation.’ I&nbsp;agree with this. But not in&nbsp;your boyfriend’s favor. A&nbsp;trip is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;one time trip, if&nbsp;things don’t work out between you and your boyfriend, they don’t have to&nbsp;keep you invited for their future trips.<br>A&nbsp;family recipe is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family recipe. Once you give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them, they have it&nbsp;forever regardless. This absolutely requires more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family status than a&nbsp;vacation.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beefsmoke&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Yes, your response is&nbsp;justified. The stakes are much lower for a&nbsp;trip than a&nbsp;family recipe. I’ve seen people stop talking to&nbsp;family for sharing it&nbsp;outside of&nbsp;the immediate family. My&nbsp;grandma is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those people and won’t even give me&nbsp;the recipes until she is&nbsp;dead.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>imf4rds&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It&nbsp;has nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the food itself. It&nbsp;has everything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with mutual respect. Despite being around them for 4&nbsp;solid years, she still felt the need to ’put you in&nbsp;your place’ by&nbsp;verbalizing to&nbsp;you that you aren’t ’real family.’ So, what was she expecting when she asked for the recipe?<br>The answer would’ve been the same for anything, and yet you still made sure to&nbsp;make enough for them to&nbsp;take home. And if&nbsp;your partner isn’t on&nbsp;your team, then he&nbsp;never will.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>OsaBear92&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Conflicts about food and cooking are more common than we’ve thought.
