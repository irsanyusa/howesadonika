(It premiered in Los Angeles the following month.) It has been playing ever since, often as a midnight show, drawing costumed devotees carrying rice, toilet paper and toast, <a href=# rel=noopener>among other props</a>, to throw at the screen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Critics almost universally slammed the film when it premiered; they’d given mixed reviews to the stage musical it was based on, too. The play had done well in London, where it began its run in 1973, and where the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times called it</a> “the trendiest entertainment in town.” In New York, the musical retained its leading man — Tim Curry, who also brings the movie to staggering heights of platform-heeled camp, and whom the Times lauded for “flashing his eyes like headlamps, tossing his curls roguishly, and talking in a voice of sugared bile” — but lost some of its audience appeal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>TIME’s reviewer</a>, for one, was not impressed. “It is not easy to see why this campy trash was a long-running hit in London and a smash success in Los Angeles,” notes the 1975 review, “except that transvestism has always fascinated the British and the L.A. scene is almost as kinky.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By 1985, <a href=#>TIME’s film critic</a> had kinder words for the movie, calling it “a cross-generational phenomenon, an evocation of ’50s monster movies wrapped in the anything-goes spirit of the ’60s that found a niche in the ’70s and has blossomed in the ’80s into a rite of passage for millions of American teenagers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The film, by now, is beside the point, as <a href=# rel=noopener>Roger Ebert noted.</a> It has evolved into a mere vehicle for the audience participation that has sustained its creative spark so long. “The Rocky Horror Picture Show is not so much a movie as more of a long-running social phenomenon,” Ebert wrote. When the movie’s midnight showings were at their peak in the ‘80s, he said:</p><figure class=text-left readability=31.5><p>…the fans put on a better show than anything on the screen. They knew the film by heart, chanted all of the lines in unison, sang along with the songs, did dances on stage, added their own unprintable additions to the screenplay, and went through a lot of props like toilet paper and water pistols. They also formed a sort of weird extended family. They met every week, exchanged ritual greetings, celebrated each other’s birthdays and other major holidays, and even dated and married and gave birth to a new generation of “Rocky Horror” cultists.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rocky Horror’s standing as a social phenomenon hasn’t wavered; if anything, it’s become more mainstream in recent years. It was the focus of a <a href=#>Glee episode</a> in 2010; this year, <a href=#>Fox announced</a> that it would give the film a modern-day makeover as a TV movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And while that remake will rely on the original script, Fox doesn’t anticipate renewed criticism for kinkiness. “Though full of innuendo,” Entertainment Weekly concludes, “it’s unlikely Rocky Horror would receive its original R rating by today’s standards.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read Richard Corliss’ take on </strong><strong>Rocky Horror in 1985, here in the TIME Vault</strong>: <a href=#>Across the Land: The Voice of Rocky Horror</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZscWhqg3eAjqumnKOpYrWwvtGoqWaomZjBtr7EZqqhp6digXF52J6Yq6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1335359-loni-anderson-bio-age-measurements-spouse-daughter-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Loni Anderson bio: age, measurements, spouse, daughter, net worth</span></a>
