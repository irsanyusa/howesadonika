During the episode, one of the puzzles required Jennings to complete the phrase “DRIVING TO RENO WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO.” This saying was under the “rhyme” category. By the time Jennings was going to guess, he only needed the letter “Q” to spell out Tarantino’s first name. However, instead of choosing the obvious “Q,” he confidently blurted out the letter “P.”</p><p>Host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pat Sajak</a>‘s response was a straightforward, “No, No, I’m sorry no.” A moment of laughter from someone in the background underscored the blunder. Jennings had $4,050 in winnings at that point, and his error left him without the chance to solve the puzzle.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Former NFL RB Rashad Jennings might have made the worst Wheel Of Fortune guess ever 😅<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/F1Jq5rKdx1</a></p>— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) <a href=#>October 19, 2023</a><p>Jennings’ mistake didn’t go unnoticed by the show’s viewers.
