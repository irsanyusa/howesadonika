Truly, they make a nice addition to the show with their positive criticisms and dynamic reactions.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Top 10 RuPaul’s Drag Race Guest Judges</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-lady-gaga>10. Lady Gaga</h2><p>We rest by the fact that there’s no other gay icon like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lady Gaga</a>. That said, having her as guest judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race season is arguably one of the most remarkable scenes of all seasons. Known for her vocal support to the queer community, Lady Gaga took her role in the series with all her heart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Leah Remini</h2><p>Actress Leah Remini quickly created an impression to Drag Race fans as a hilarious guest judge. She is most notable for frequent bickers against regular judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Visage</a>. Nevertheless, Remini is evidently passionate in performing her duty in the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Leslie Jones</h2><p>Comedian Leslie Jones is not merely a guest judge, but a superfan of the reality series herself. During her time on Drag Race, her ecstatic energy was contagious. Clearly, Jones is one of the guest judges that we want to see in the panel again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Rachel Bloom</h2><p>Actress Rachel Bloom entered Drag Race alongside actor Jeff Goldblum for the show’s Choices 2020 episode. Bloom was eight months pregnant when the show invited her to serve as guest judge. Consequently, being in the series got her emotional, thinking how proud she’d be if her son would be a drag diva.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Nicki Minaj</h2><p>Back in season 12, the “Super Bass” hitmaker appeared in the show in a vibrant all-red outfit. She judged every queen’s performance in the rap-based maxi challenge, spotting rooms for improvement. The spicy bonus came when Nicki Minaj did a freestyle rap during that episode.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Jennifer Lewis</h2><p>Veteran actress Jennifer Lewis blessed drag queens with her presence during RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season 4. Before she was guest judge, she’s already had friendly connections with drag queen Shangela. Ultimately, her energetic comments and animated reactions are most remembered by fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Elvira</h2><p>Horror hostess character Elvira is a legendary guest judge, to say the least. She’s been in the judging panel for multiple times, and we’re not even confused why. Elvira’s valid critiques are worth taking, and her sense of humor is top-notch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Nicole Byer</h2><p>Comedian Nicole Byer is one among the guest judges who fully understood Drag Race quips and puns. Byer is a long-time fan of the reality series, os she poured a high level of commitment into her role as a guest judge. By now, we must agree that Bryer deserves a permanent seat in the panel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Christina Aguilera</h2><p>Pop icon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Aguilera</a> is absolutely one of the LGBTQ+ allies that fans would beg to see on the show again. She rocked the Drag Race runway when she dressed up as season 8 contestant Farrah Moan. Indeed, her entrance in the reality series was iconic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Miley Cyrus</h2><p>Disguising herself as a sound guy, the “Wrecking Ball” singer has made queens hysterical in the werkroom. Coming into the season 11 of the series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miley Cyrus</a> has taken her role in the panel seriously. She’s given constructive advice to every queen, even going as far as having an emotional conversation with them.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AdamLambert_Kiss_AmericanIdol_viaPintrest-220x184.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’ Finale Duets You Probably Forgot About" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706inZmlgYrCmuMSbqaKsqWK0trHSrWSjrZScsrR5zqdkq62glsKtv4ydqZqfXaeupLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1483312-leilani-greens-biography-age-ethnicity-boyfriend-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Leilani Greens biography: age, ethnicity, boyfriend, net worth</span></a>
