The polling took place after Murray won his first round match at Wimbledon against Germany’s Benjamin Becker in straight sets.</p><p>While this 53% is lower than when YouGov first asked the question two and a half years ago, the polling appears to mostly contradict what many have claimed about British attitudes towards the tennis star – namely, that to non-Scottish Britons he is "<a href=#>Scottish when he loses and British when he wins</a>".</p><p>YouGov has been tracking how people in Britain think of Andy Murray since his January 2011 loss to Novak Djokovic. At the time, nearly six in ten (59%) Britons – including 85% of Scots – said they thought of the tennis star, who was born in Glasgow and raised in Dunblane, as Scottish compared to only 29% who though thought of him as British.</p><p>Today, just over a third (35%) of people from across Great Britain (including Scotland) think of Murray as British.</p><p>Since 2011, Murray has racked up a number of major wins and losses, including a loss at the 2012 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer followed by two wins, one at the Summer Olympics and another at the US Open His ranking has steadily risen from #5 in the world in 2011 to #2 today. The only time the proportion of the nation who thought of Murray as Scottish dropped below 50% was immediately after his gold medal win at London 2012.</p><p>Interestingly, though more people from England and Wales think of Murray as British now than in 2011, the proportion of Scots who think of Murray as Scottish has declined from 85% in 2011 to just 70% today.</p><p>YouGov's Opigram system, which constantly records <a href=#>how those who like and dislike Andy Murray describe him</a>, does find that one of the most popular words used by his fans to describe him is "<b>Scottish</b>". However, fans describe Murray even more often as "<b>competitive</b>", "<b>talented</b>" and "<strong>determined</strong>".</p><p>As a 17-year-old, Murray found himself in hot water with many English fans after joking that he would "<a href=#>support whoever England was playing against</a>" at the 2006 World Cup.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=title><a href=#>Not yet a member of YouGov?
