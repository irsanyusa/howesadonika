And who could the celebrity under it be?

The Macaw started his clues by saying the Macaw is everything he’s not, “flashy, confident, and he sings country sings.” He says that he’s been performing “since a young age” and we see a black and white performance happening on an old school TV. It didn’t start out as a passion though, his dad would bribe him with quesadillas to perform at a Mexican restaurant. The camera zooms in on a jar of salsa. Eventually, he spread his wings on bigger stages, but the pressure to always be “the good son” has brought him a lot of anxiety. We see two arrows pointing up.</p><p>But somewhere on his journey, he learned to take breaks and reset. What started as a way to make his parents happy now fills him with “glee.” This is the year he decided to be brave not only on stage but in his life. Once his performance ended, Deana Carter brought out one last clue. It was a silver medal! The Macaw explained, “It wasn’t until I left the nest that I struck gold.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MEDUSA?

But Jenny predicted it could be Zayn Malik from One Direction, though Robin didn’t agree with her. Nicole seemed to think she knew who it was based on the voice, guessing Doug Robb from Hoobastank. Online, popular guesses include Dan from Dan + Shay, David Archuleta, and Ne-Yo.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?

The salsa is also a clue about one of his parents, because his mom was a salsa singer and dancer. We saw a TV at the beginning of his clues and David was on both Star Search and <a href=#>American Idol</a>. Macaw also mentioned that he’s been performing since a young age and David Archuleta started singing at 6 and won the Utah Talent Competition at age 10.</p><p>He talked about feeling pressure to be “the good son” and we saw two arrows pointing up in the clues. David was raised in the LDS church and felt a lot of pressure from the church and from his dad, which he’s said in interviews. This also explains him talking about his anxiety and previous panic attacks. Macaw claimed this is the year he decided to be brave…in life, and David just came out in 2021. The dolphin could be another nod to his time on American Idol, because the top four on his season visited the dolphins at the Mirage.</p><p>His mention of glee could be pointing to his work with Kevin McHale from Glee on his recent “Faith in Me” music video. Macaw also talked about “striking gold” after leaving his nest, and after American Idol, David’s first single and album were huge successes. His first single, “Crush,” entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number two, and his first album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Finally, the silver medal is a nod to his second place finish on American Idol.</p><p>Do you agree that the Macaw is David Archuleta?
