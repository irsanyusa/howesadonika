While most are unknown for the most part, others have looked pretty familiar. If you’ve also watched The Voice, you probably noticed a few familiar faces on this season of American Idol.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Are So Many Former The Voice Singers Auditioning For American Idol?</h2><p>Each season, various artists take to both The Voice and American Idol stages. On occasion, some familiar faces appear on a show, after they’ve previously appeared on another. We’ve already seen a few instances of this on season 21 of American Idol, like Marybeth Byrd and Wé Ani McDonald; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m sure</a> there will be a few more before auditions conclude.</p><p>Although it’s not discouraged for up and coming artists to take the stage of multiple talent shows, many will question why they’re doing it. While we don’t know the exact reason, we can assume that they’ve progressed or improved in some way. Now, they’re ready to show that off to the world on a national scale.</p><p>On the flipside, many could argue that these artists are joining another show because they weren’t given their big break. It’s no secret that American Idol is known for producing stars such as Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and more, while The Voice seems to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lack in that area</a>. Even though The Voice always features insanely talented singers, the possibility of breaking into mainstream music is much lower than its competitor American Idol.</p><p>Instead of looking differently at artists that have been on two shows, it should be encouraged. These artists have been willing to put everything on the line not once, but twice. It says a lot about their character and passion for their craft.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/O_J8GOxHE70</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-marybeth-byrd-we-ani-mcdonald-we-both-given-an-american-idol-golden-ticket>Marybeth Byrd, Wé Ani McDonald We Both Given an American Idol Golden Ticket</h2><p>So far, we’ve seen both Marybeth Byrd (The Voice season 17) and Wé Ani McDonald (The Voice season 11) audition for American Idol season 21. Both artists have earned Golden Tickets and a one-way trip into Hollywood Week, but where did they start?</p><p>Marybeth Byrd took <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> stage in September 2019, singing “Angel From Montgomery” by John Prine. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Her rendition</a> of this tune turned the chairs of Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, and John Legend. Clarkson hit her block to block Blake Shelton from turning for the singer. As part of Team Legend, the 18 year old soared through the competition, making it into the semifinals before final elimination.</p><p>At only 17 years old, Wé Ani McDonald took The Voice stage in September 2016 singing “Feeling Good.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Her rendition</a> was so good, that coaches Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Alicia Keys all turned for her. As part of Team Alicia, Wé successfully competed in each round of the competition, she even finished in third place of the season.</p><p>It’s clear from American Idol auditions that these artists have improved and developed their own styles since their time on The Voice. Be sure to tune into American Idol on Mondays and Sundays to witness these artists’ journeys and more.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/American-Idol-Cay-Aliese-220x176.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Season 21 Auditions Continue After the Oscars" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZpmimnq1tMRmraihk5p6tLXNoJyrq12Yv7C%2F0qKloGWfq7KzedOoZJqllae2pK3NZqCdp5xk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./un-decret-apporte-quelques-ameliorations-la-cmu-c.html><span>←</span><span>Un dcret apporte quelques amliorations la CMU-C</span></a>
