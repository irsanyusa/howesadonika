Perched on an ornate armchair in his office last week, Colonel Marcos Pérez Jiménez, President of oil-rich Venezuela, received with protocolary propriety Admiral Jerauld Wright, U.S.N., commander of NATO’s Atlantic Fleet. The next day, with solemn ceremony, President Pérez Jiménez opened the 1955 session of his obedient Congress.
But it was not for due care to such affairs of state that Pérez Jiménez drew his countrymen’s attention.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Dining Table : 10 Picks for Any Budget and Room Size</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Having a proper pillow is crucial to maintaining a good night’s sleep—there’s nothing worse than waking up with neck pain from a flat pillow. However, buying a pillow feels like an even bigger pain in the neck, because there are thousands of options to filter through, and they all start to look the same after a few scrolls. If you’re caught between wanting the softness of down pillows (or down alternative pillows) but with a bit more support, consider a memory foam pillow.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cadbury Castle, Somerset popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

On November 5, 1990, an Arab gunman assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane during a speech at Marriot Hotel in New York City. My mother woke me up the minute she saw the breaking news on TV, and we fled the house in a terrified daze. I was 7 years old at the time—a shy, chubby New Jersey kid in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pajamas. The gunman was my father.
My father’s despicable act decimated my family.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Keith Griffiths, award-winning Welsh architect</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

As my siblings were retiring, my parents were getting older and my children enjoyed St Davids, I bought a property here: Penrhiw Priory. We refurbished it as an eight bedroom house for the family. Eventually we rented it out so it wouldn't fall into decay, then started letting it out as a holiday home. It was too big for this, though, and it rapidly turned into a hotel.&nbsp;
While we were doing that, I was offered Roch Castle, which was too good an opportunity to turn down.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lea Michele, Paul Walker, One Direction: Most Retweeted Tweets 2013</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Un an après la publication de la loi du 1er décembre 2008 généralisant le revenu de solidarité active (RSA)&nbsp;et réformant les politiques d'insertion, Martin Hirsch a profité d'un déplacement à Poitiers pour dresser un premier bilan de cette réforme phare du mandat de Nicolas Sarkozy. Essentiellement quantitatif - faute d'un recul suffisant -, ce bilan est d'abord celui de la mise en oeuvre des dispositions législatives. Sur ce point, le haut-commissaire aux Solidarités actives contre la pauvreté fait valoir une publication intégrale de tous les textes d'application de la loi du 1er décembre, dont sept décrets.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who were the late Bob Ross spouses?
