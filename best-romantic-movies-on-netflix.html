A romantic movie tracing the pattern of a relationship can immediately bring us back to the giddiness of a first crush or the uncertainty that follows a breakup.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Romantic movies, specifically romantic comedies, have been declared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“dead”</a> for years. But just because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood isn’t churning out meet-cute scenes</a> at the rate that it used to does not mean that people aren’t looking for a good romantic movie to watch. Everyone loves love. Now, should you base real life decisions off what occurs in a romantic movie? Absolutely not — you (probably) wouldn’t risk your life to save a stranger after watching a Marvel movie, either. Still, there is no need to write off romantic movies entirely, especially when staying in with a significant other on Valentine’s Day beats dealing with the crowds outside.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a world of romance movies out there, and whether you’re in the mood to laugh over a rom-com heroine’s latest missteps or a sad romance that will bring out all the sobs, Netflix has a large collection of romantic movies that are new to the streaming service in 2019.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Check out some of the best romantic movies you can stream on Netflix in time for Valentine’s day in 2019.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Breaker Upperers (available Feb. 15)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an effort to make some cash, best friends Mel (Madeleine Sami) and Jen (Jackie van Beek) will do just about anything to end relationships for money. But things go awry when one of them decides she’s not so interested in the business of love-breaking. If romance isn’t really your thing— or you’re just looking to laugh this Valentine’s Day—look no further than this Netflix original Australian comedy, which comes to the streaming service on Feb. 15.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Set It Up </strong><strong>(2018)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harper (Zoey Deutch) and Charlie (Glen Powell) are fed up with being assistants to bosses who don’t know the concept of work-life balance. After embarking on a plan to set the two up—played by the ever-fabulous Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs—pizza is eaten, tears are shed, Pete Davidson makes jokes and our two match-makers will be put to the test. One of Netflix’s new original films, Set It Up has all the makings of a perfect rom-com. With flirting, tension, drama, best friendships and a Parent Trap-like plot, what’s not to love?</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before </strong><strong>(2018)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lara Jean (Lana Condor) is a teenage girl with few friends, dreams and several crushes. But after all of her love letters end up in the hands of their subjects, her nonexistent love life becomes something of a mess. An instant hit, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before spurred a world of <a href=#>Twitter love</a> and, according to Netflix, almost 50% of viewers who watched To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before re-watched it. The platform also said it was one of its most-viewed original movies of the year. This may or may not have something to do with Noah Centineo’s role as Lara Jean’s love interest.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Alex Strangelove</strong><strong> (2018)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Netflix original movie Alex Strangelove, tells the story of Alex Truelove (Daniel Doheny), a high schooler whose life is turned upside down as he begins to come into his own sexual identity.

Will concedes that he’ll detail the stories of his exes (Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks and Rachel Weisz), but Maya has to guess which woman from the stories is her mom.

The women form an intimate connection that takes them to the nicest Manhattan restaurants, a road trip and through multiple hotel rooms, while Carol’s impending divorce looms, along with a threat from her controlling husband to reveal her homosexuality and take away custody of their daughter. Based on Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel The Price of Salt, Carol was a critical smash, receiving multiple Academy Awards and Golden Globes nominations.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Our Souls At Night (2017)</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While they appeared as newlyweds in the aforementioned Barefoot in the Park, Robert Redford and Jane Fonda are back together for another romantic movie in Our Souls At Night.
