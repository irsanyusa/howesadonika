The next morning, “I woke up with about a million views on YouTube, and it was like, What the heck?” Larsen said. It ignited her dance career and also opened the door to modeling. “I love fusing dance, fashion and modeling together,” she said.</p><p><strong>Latest Project:</strong> Last year, Thompson starred in the 1950s-themed dance video for Pink’s “Beautiful Trauma.” Thompson portrayed the pop singer in a modest jade dress, dancing with friends in a boxing ring. Pink wasn’t in the music video, but she retained full creative control over the costumes and helped produce the video via FaceTime.</p><p><strong>Next Thing:</strong> Acting is Thompson’s next focus. She will appear in a supporting role in the film “Family Tree,” starring Seann William Scott. “It’s a cool, mysterious, crime-related movie,” she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Finding Her Voice: </strong>Thompson might be balancing several creative projects, as well as her studies (she is a junior at Newbury Park High School), but she ultimately wants to become a pop star. “Right now I’m working on my voice,” she said. “I haven’t written a song yet, but this year I’m going to write a song for sure and get it out.” She described her voice as “raspy” and a combination of “Lorde, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.”</p><p>This article originally appeared in The New York Times.</p><p>Ilana Kaplan © 2018 The New York Times</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwIylmKurlaN6tbTOpqesp55iwamxjJ2Yp5uVp3qnvs6mZKyhkah6tbTEZp6rnZGpsrTAjK%2BgnZ2fYsSiutOsZK2nXZeybq2On2%2BjcKOhhg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worlds-biggest-soccer-football-academy-china.html><span>←</span><span>Football: Welcome to the World's Biggest Soccer Academy</span></a>
