<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>What Mandatory School Uniforms Look Like in 14 Different Countries</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There are many opinions of&nbsp;whether or&nbsp;not school uniforms are necessary. Those who support this idea say that uniforms help to&nbsp;make kids more disciplined, equal and united, and parents don’t have to&nbsp;think about what clothes to&nbsp;buy for their kids. Those who are against uniforms say that such approach kills individuality and doesn’t impact the educational process at&nbsp;all.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> don’t want to&nbsp;argue; we&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;simply show you what uniforms kids wear in&nbsp;different countries around the world. Indeed, many of&nbsp;the uniforms look quite trendy and practical.</p><p><h2>Japan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f7/917/cc983a522d92cb0932264580d2.jpg><p>The <a href=# title=Japanese data-link=tag>Japanese</a> <strong>school uniform for girls, “seifuku,”</strong> is&nbsp;famous all around the world thanks to&nbsp;anime cartoons and manga comic books. It&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;a&nbsp;blouse in&nbsp;sea style and a&nbsp;pleated skirt that becomes shorter and shorter the older girls get. Shoes with a&nbsp;small hill and knee socks are absolutely necessary. They even wear them in&nbsp;winter. In&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;let the socks slide down, girls use special glue.</p><p><h2>Great Britain</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c7/521/7237a55f819d695feb5d6f338f.jpg><p>School dress code is&nbsp;<strong>very strict in&nbsp;<a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a></strong>. The very first uniform was blue. This color was believed to&nbsp;teach kids how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;organized and calm (and it&nbsp;was the cheapest kind of&nbsp;fabric). Now every school has its own school uniform and symbols. Some schools even have such strict rules that they don’t allow students to&nbsp;wear shorts in&nbsp;very hot weather. This summer boys at&nbsp;one school went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;strike and came to&nbsp;school wearing skirts. After this, many schools made gender-neutral uniforms.</p><p><h2>Australia</h2></p><p>The <a href=# title=Australian data-link=tag>Australian</a> educational system borrowed many things from Great Britain. <strong>Their school uniforms resemble the British ones very much,</strong> only they are more open and light. Many schools also require students to&nbsp;wear hats due to&nbsp;the very hot climate.</p><p><h2>Cuba</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f15/d2b/b57dc95edfb9d67d4e622ae1f5.jpg><p>There are a&nbsp;few variations of&nbsp;uniforms in&nbsp;Cuba: white top with yellow bottom, and blue top with dark blue bottom. They also have white shirts and red sundresses or&nbsp;pants with <strong>a&nbsp;necessary element&nbsp;— a&nbsp;tie</strong>, which the Soviet students are very familiar with (though it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;both red and blue).</p><p><h2>Indonesia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cb/712/e2db8952249f9064db7b89dd3b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# title=Indonesia data-link=tag>Indonesia</a>, the school uniform colors are different depending on&nbsp;the stage of&nbsp;education. The top is&nbsp;always white, but the bottom can be&nbsp;red, dark blue, or&nbsp;grey. The most interesting part comes later: after the students pass a&nbsp;national exam, they celebrate their “freedom” <strong>by&nbsp;painting each other’s uniforms different colors using markers and spray paint</strong>. Farewell school!</p><p><h2>China</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c75/5e3/1443135d3eac1851d046bf62ff.jpg><p><a href=# title=Chinese data-link=tag>Chinese</a> students have a&nbsp;few sets of&nbsp;uniform: for holidays and ordinary days, for summer and winter. Everyday uniforms for girls and boys are almost identical and they <strong>look a&nbsp;lot like sportswear</strong>.</p><p><h2>Ghana</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c19/f85/cb2bae5f68897149f99dbe1e73.jpg><p>All children in&nbsp;the country are required to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;uniform, but Ghana, like the majority of&nbsp;African countries, has very low incomes and a&nbsp;very high level of&nbsp;poverty among its population. <strong>So, buying a&nbsp;uniform is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the obstacles that doesn’t allow many kids to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;education</strong>. In&nbsp;2010, the government spread the uniform for free across different towns.</p><p><h2>Vietnam</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/388/d26/f165ea5ff5ab417ab17747c74e.jpg><p>The dress code in&nbsp;elementary and secondary schools is&nbsp;quite ordinary, but the girls from high school can wear a&nbsp;<strong>white national costume- “ao&nbsp;dai</strong>.” In&nbsp;some schools, girls wear them only on&nbsp;special occasions and ceremonies, and others require the costume to&nbsp;be&nbsp;worn every day.</p><p><h2>Syria</h2></p><p>The school uniform in&nbsp;Syria <strong>was changed from the dull khaki to&nbsp;brighter colors (blue, grey, and pink)</strong> long before the military conflict due to&nbsp;political reasons. It&nbsp;symbolized the wish to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;peace in&nbsp;the Middle East. Maybe one day...</p><p><h2>Bhutan</h2></p><p>Another country where school students <strong>wear a&nbsp;traditional national costume</strong> is&nbsp;Bhutan. The girls’ clothes are called “kira” and the boys’ are called “gho.” Kids used to&nbsp;carry all textbooks and school supplies in&nbsp;the clothes, but now they have backpacks and other bags. Still, some use their clothes to&nbsp;carry something.</p><p><h2>South Korea</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a04/b78/29e55b52e89aec48c72d243dc6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;South Korea, kids study from morning till evening. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;wonder that many of&nbsp;them think that schools are a&nbsp;romantic place since they spend most of&nbsp;their lives there. Dress code is&nbsp;required and regulated by&nbsp;schools themselves, <strong>but uniforms are quite popular even outside schools and among celebrities.</strong></p><p><h2>Sri Lanka</h2></p><p><strong>In&nbsp;Sri Lanka, students have to&nbsp;wear white uniforms. </strong>Girls wear dresses with ties, but the sleeves and collars can be&nbsp;different. Boys wear white shirts and blue shorts. On&nbsp;special occasions, boys wear white shorts. We&nbsp;wonder how long they stay clean.</p><p><h2>North Korea</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/75e/f75/9f34d253ce93a9383e5b3c94eb.jpg><p>In&nbsp;North Korea, school uniforms are mandatory: girls wear dresses and boys wear shirts with pants. But the most curious part of&nbsp;the uniform is&nbsp;the <strong>obligatory red scarf</strong> that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;support for the North Korean political party.</p><p><h2>India</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/984/8cf/9dde3c5c1185ec92616824d82e.jpg><p>Most Indian schools have mandatory uniforms. Boys have to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;buttoned-shirt with short sleeves, a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;short pants, socks, and dark shoes. Girls, however, <strong>wear both a&nbsp;knee-long tunic and pants with shoes.</strong></p><p>Which uniform did you like the best?
