It saw FBI agents Holden Ford (Groff) and Bill Tench (McCallany) interview even more notable killers than the first season, with scenes featuring <a href=# id=a7ab5ea8-64cc-37b2-a5a5-f67d5f4a077c>Son of Sam</a> , <a href=# id=aaac5937-98fc-3d36-abc4-301d30eb8a9b>Charles Manson</a> , and a return of the show's popular <a href=# id=68c51310-9060-3c3e-a997-66de8a2d8d7e>Ed Kemper</a> portrayal.</p><p>Mank, a biopic about Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, will be Fincher's first feature film since 2014's Gone Girl. It will star Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, and Lily Collins. The director is considered by many to be among the best in the industry, having made The Social Network, Fight Club, and Zodiac among others. Fincher is also working on producing a second season of Love, Death, and Robots, a genre-bending adult animation series on Netflix that he made with Deadpool and Terminator: Dark Fate director Tim Miller.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Cast members in the past have expressed interest in continuing with the show. Groff told EW that a third season would happen when Fincher "was ready to tell the next step of the story, and reminded that it took a year and a half in between the show's first and second season; sounded like he was anticipating that Fincher would be occupied in the near future. McCallany also mentioned that the show had a "five-year</p><p>With Fincher focusing on other projects, obviously Mindhunter's future is looking very cloudy. But fans might be able to entertain a pipe dream of another super-acclaimed director taking over the series: in a previous interview, Bong Joon-Ho (Academy Award nominated director and writer this year for his work on <a href=# id=52eb462d-0287-3eb3-aba7-e7170407b81d>Parasite</a> ) was asked what TV show he would love to guest write and direct. His answer? Mindhunter.</p><p>As fun as it is to imagine, fans probably shouldn't hold their breath too much for that one. Even outside of his film career, Bong has a couple other TV projects already on the horizon. Just last week, HBO announced a television expansion/adaptation of Parasite (we imagine it would be <a href=# id=ed329eb2-2fba-354e-abfd-77b33c017a66>Watchmen</a> -esque), and the much-delayed TV series of Snowpiercer (Bong's 2013 film starring Chris Evans) <a href=# id=5988ddef-ccf0-39e0-a441-b0db8c1baa5c>was finally given a release date for later this year</a> too. On top of the obvious logistical bumps that would come with one huge filmmaker taking over for another, the scheduling seems like it would be yet another factor working against this pipe dream.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Fans reacting to the news weren't happy either:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>We need to be clear here, thoughthe fact that Netflix hasn't outwardly come out and said that Mindhunter is cancelled is a good sign for the show's future. If and when Fincher wants to make a new season, you know that Netflix will be downand you wouldn't want him to force something he doesn't believe in, right? As long as the actors maintain flexible and game to participate, chances are reasonably good that Mindhunter will return.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLnIp5uhrZ6psrO%2FjK2foqqUYsCmrdKopWalmZy1tXnNqKtmmpVitaK8z56loqaXYq6nwMSrZJqknGS%2FdLjRoK5p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./milestones-nov-24-1952.html><span>←</span><span>Milestones, Nov. 24, 1952 | TIME</span></a>
