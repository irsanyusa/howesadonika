With more surprises and bigger celebrities than ever promised, it’s going to be epic. And the Raccoon definitely tore up the stage! He has a lot of energy and quite the vocals.</strong> <strong>You should check out the video where I reveal to Mel, who I know is the Raccoon. You’ll agree, trust me.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The panelists thought The Masked Singer Raccoon has to be a huge star…a legend even! But who is it? And which celebrities do the clues point to? All that and more below.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clues-on-the-masked-singer-season-5>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 5</h4><p>In the first clue package, we learned a lot about the Raccoon. First, one of the Men in Black carries in a donut. Raccon mentions having to “go through Hell” while he’s in what looks like a prison cell. He’s adding the 44th notch on a wall. In his “darkest days,” he “faced death.” A pocket knife is shown on screen.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>Raccoon then talks about how he got through a hard time by reciting The Hunchback of Notre Dame, one of his favorite stories. He’s reading it with a magnifying glass. He sees himself as Quasimodo, “the only difference is he was innocent and I was actually a monster.” Raccoon prayed, saying if he got a second chance at life, he would use it to do good. When he looks up, there’s colorful banners in the window and stained glass above him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13ba7IZufEs</p>The Masked Singer Raccoon clues and performance from the Season 5 Premiere</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-popular-guesses-for-the-masked-singer-raccoon>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Raccoon</h4><p>The panelists have predicted that the Raccoon could be Gary Busey, Nick Nolte, Sammy Hagar, Mike Tyson, Danny DeVito, or Joe Pesci. But online, the only one of those being mentioned is Gary Busey. People have also been guessing Danny Trejo, Ray Liotta, and Brian Johnson from AC/DC.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-raccoon-on-the-masked-singer>Who is the Raccoon on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Well, thanks to some very specific clues, this one actually came together pretty easily. And the judges were right: the Raccoon is someone legendary! Under the Raccoon mask is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p><strong>Actor Danny Trejo!</strong></p><p>And all the clues line up perfectly! Let’s go through them. First of all, we saw a donut, which is a nod to one of Danny Trejo’s restaurant endeavors, Trejo’s Donuts. He says he’s been “locked away” and there are many nods to being in jail. Danny was in and out of prison for much of his early life. In the jail cell, we also see 44 notches, which points to the year he was born: 1944. The mention The Hunchback of Notre Dame make sense too, since Danny Trejo has said that he recited it during his time in solitary confinement in <a href=#>interviews</a> before.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FOR MORE CLUES DECODED: <a href=#>RUSSIAN DOLLS</a> | <a href=#>SEASHELL</a> | <a href=#>ROBOPINE</a></strong></p><p>We also saw a few references to his Mexican heritage, including papel picado and a stained glass window that looks similar to the center of the Mexican flag. When he talked about wanting to do good and crediting that to a relationship with God, that is also something we know about Danny Trejo. Lastly, Cluedle-doo’s hint was that he’s “known for being sharp.” Danny’s roles were named after knives in all his projects with Robert Rodriguez. In Spy Kids, his name was Machete; in the From Dusk Til Dawn series, Razor Charlie; and in Desperado, Navajas (Spanish for folding knife).</p><p>Do you agree with our prediction?
