Meanwhile, on TikTok, videos related to Talk to Me have received <a href=#>over 60 million views</a> to date.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Acquired by A24 following a breakout premiere at Sundance, the feature directorial debut from Australian filmmaking brothers and <a href=#>RackaRacka YouTube creators</a> Danny and Michael Philippou puts a modern spin on a tried-and-true horror trope: otherworldly<strong> </strong>possession.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I've always been fascinated by possessions and the paranormal, in general," Michael tells TIME. "When you watch videos of people being possessed and see these horrible things happen, how much of it is mental perception? How much of it is you telling yourself that you're hearing or experiencing something as opposed to reality?"</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>21 Underrated Horror Movies You Probably Haven't Seen</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Talk to Me gives a grieving teen a hand</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The story centers on teenager<strong> </strong>Mia (Sophie Wilde), who has turned to the family of her best friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen) for comfort following the death of her mother, rather than deal with the distance that's developed between her and her father (Marcus Johnson) in the past year. She's vulnerable, and clearly struggling—and eager to take any opportunity to get out of her own head, even for just a little while.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Mia starts seeing videos circulate on social media of her classmates grabbing hold of a white ceramic hand and appearing to be possessed by spirits that are conjured from it, she decides to check out what the fuss is all about. At the next party, she's the first to volunteer to take the hand—which is supposedly the embalmed, severed appendage of a dead medium—for a spin.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rules of the hand are simple: Light a candle, clasp the hand, speak the words "talk to me," and invite the spirit in. But no matter what, don't leave the door to the spirit world open for more than 90 seconds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"What happens after 90 seconds?" Mia asks before her first go-around. "They'll want to stay," replies her classmate Hayley (Zoe Terakes), one of the hand's keepers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A spirit enters Mia, transforming her face into a demonic mask, and she experiences the unparalleled high of possession as her peers whip out their cell phones to capture it all on camera and post it online. But, of course, things go awry and the spirit ends up overstaying its welcome, setting Mia on a course of increasingly terrifying and violent events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Talk-to-Me-Mia.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the Philippous, making the central haunted object a hand, a physical representation of connection, was a decision rooted in personal experience. When he was 16, Danny was badly injured in a car accident and couldn't stop shaking after he was taken to the hospital—until his sister sat next to him and held his hand.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"The shaking stopped. The touch of someone I love brought me out of it," he says. "The power of that moment and the power of touch really stuck with me."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>10 Low-Budget Horror Movies That Have Terrified Audiences</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The horror classic that inspired Talk to Me</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Talk to Me plays like The Exorcist for the social media generation, and the filmmakers cite the 1973 classic as an inspiration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"All the horrific scenes in The Exorcist are so rooted in character," Danny says. "The mom's reactions to everything feel so real, like her trying to figure out [what's happening to her daughter] and, after everything, finally succumbing and going to the church and asking them about exorcism because there's no other possible answer. It was always in my head to try to have characters that feel as real as she did."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unlike in The Exorcist, the characters of<strong> </strong>Talk to Me quickly accept that demonic possession is real and use it for fun, says Michael. "It's like what would kids nowadays be doing? And that's exactly what would happen."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the tradition of The Exorcist and other possession movies like The Evil Dead and Hereditary, Talk to Me is also rife with gut-churning sequences—courtesy of some gruesome practical effects enhanced with CGI—that have the potential to test the sensibilities of even seasoned horror fans. But the Philippous say they don't want their gore to be over the top<strong>. </strong>While editing the movie, they cut one<strong> </strong>David Cronenberg-esque scene that plays a pivotal role in the movie's climax down to 15 seconds, from its original two-minutes-and-30-seconds runtime, realizing it was getting to "feel a bit too <a href=#>splatter</a>," Danny says. "We've always wanted our horror to be rooted in character and not feel like we're being gratuitous for gratuity's sake. We want there to be meaning behind all of it."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ultimately, amid all the ghosts and gore, Talk to Me is a meditation on the ways that grief can change and consume us. But unfortunately for Mia, the lesson comes at a high price.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"There are steps that Mia can take from the very beginning to go down a different path, but she buries herself deeper instead," Danny says. "I really empathize with the character and understand, but there are clear choices [that would lead to] a different outcome and she doesn't make them. It's tragic."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlthHZ8jq2YpaNdqbxuucRmm6KqlZjBsL7SZqCnrJWnw6qx1mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plus-du-quart-des-beneficiaires-du-rsa-activite-nont-pas-demploi.html><span>←</span><span>Plus du quart des bnficiaires du RSA-activit n'ont pas d'emploi</span></a>
