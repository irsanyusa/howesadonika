And all it took was one errantly blurted out sentence of conventional political wisdom from a campaign adviser on <a href=#>CNN</a>.</p><p>“You hit a reset button for the fall campaign,” adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said, when asked how a campaign changes its tactics from primary season to a general election. “Everything changes. It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.”</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Mitt Romney’s Etch A Sketch Disaster</a>)</p><p>Envisioning the candidacy of Mitt Romney as a nostalgic toy that only takes one shake to turn a carefully crafted image into a blank page proved just too irresistible for just about everyone on the Internet.</p><p>It’s the type of meme that both conservatives and liberals gleefully participated in, because it’s a much more light-hearted way to make the same argument about Romney — that he has no “core,” as Rick Santorum would say — without describing him as some sort of a <a href=#>pink-slip happy</a> Steve Carell or ruthless preprogrammed GOP-bot.</p><p>As TIME’s <a href=#>James Poniewozik</a> already detailed, there was, of course, the rapid response from the Democratic National Committee, which released a video repurposing the same Romney flip-flops with an Etch A Sketch theme. And Rick Santorum’s people knew a political gift when they saw one — his staffers tweeted <a href=#>a photo</a> of the candidate playing with the toy just hours after gaffe and he even brought it <a href=#>on stage</a> with him at a campaign rally.&nbsp;Similarly, Newt Gingrich appeared on stage brandishing the toy and tweeting about it .</p><p>(<strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Did I Just Say That Out Loud? Romney Adviser’s Unerasable Etch-a-Sketch Comment</a>)</p><p>But more fun was seeing response of people presumably not on campaign payroll. Like <a href=#>this video</a> by political humor website Gotcha Media, which quickly spliced together an old-timey Etch a Sketch commercial (and theme song) in with Romney’s more memorable gaffes.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1QiB4m66zg]</p><p>Or <a href=#>this website</a>, made by new media consultant&nbsp;Matt Ortega (<a href=#>who built</a> multiplechoicemitt.com last year) which features a perfectly rendered Etch A Sketch-looking domain&nbsp;where you can endlessly shake the toy and see Mitt quotes appear and disappear. Ortega <a href=#>tweeted</a> yesterday that the site was already approaching 100,000 hits.</p><p>And, of course, the makers of Etch A Sketch were called to give their two cents on the dizzying revival of the toy. The company responded to <a href=#>Fortune&nbsp;magazine</a>, seeming pretty pleased.</p><p>“Happy to see Etch A Sketch, an American classic toy, is DRAWING attention with political candidates as a cultural icon and important piece of our society. A profound toy, highly recognized and loved by all, is now SHAKING up the national debate,” the statement read.</p><p>The company added: “It is too early to tell, but we are hopeful to see if there is an uptake in sales given this recent exposure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH10e5FrZp6ulafGsLrEZqOorpWoeqJ5xqimnWWVqbCpecBmqqSdpJi1brnEppxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doctor-who-david-tennant-catherine-tate-2706.html><span>←</span><span>David Tennant and Catherine Tate to Reprise 'Doctor Who' Roles for 60th Anniversary</span></a>
