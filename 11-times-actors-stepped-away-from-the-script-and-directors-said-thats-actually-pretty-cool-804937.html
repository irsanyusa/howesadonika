All because they not only follow what the movie director says, but they also create the flick together with them&nbsp;— and they’re not scared to&nbsp;improvise.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side </strong>recalled some cases when actors and actresses added something to&nbsp;the filming process and the movie only became better because of&nbsp;it. The bonus part at&nbsp;the end will tell you how an&nbsp;accidental slip of&nbsp;the tongue inspired the scriptwriters to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;cult ending to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series’ entire season.</p><p><h2>Emma Watson refused to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;corset on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e0/47b/887e0d5b0bae1ad977ab8d2193.jpg><p><a href=# title="Emma Watson" data-link=tag>Emma Watson</a> decided to&nbsp;make her character more active and mobile. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;wear corsets while shooting the flick to&nbsp;let Belle easily ride a&nbsp;horse and dance. Her costumes were all light and beautiful, and they weren’t too tight on&nbsp;the waist, never hindering her character’s movements.</p><p><h2>Gerard Butler wasn’t supposed to&nbsp;scream the phrase, “This is&nbsp;Sparta!”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb1/899/32f16b509087f28545802a9190.jpg><p>The scream of&nbsp;King Leonidas, “This is&nbsp;Sparta!” was not actually in&nbsp;the plan of&nbsp;the scene. According to&nbsp;the director, Butler was supposed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>whisper</a> those words. The actor asked for another take. His scream almost made everyone on&nbsp;the set laugh, but the director liked&nbsp;it. This is&nbsp;how an&nbsp;unplanned take stayed in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>When shooting <i>Titanic</i>, Kate Winslet decided to&nbsp;spit at&nbsp;her character’s fiancé.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36d/eed/ada96f53ea9a29b20403b1a3f4.jpg><p><a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offered</a> another variant of&nbsp;her character’s behavior at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the panic in&nbsp;the ship. Rose rushes to&nbsp;help Jack, while Cal is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;stop his fiancée. According to&nbsp;the script, the girl was supposed to&nbsp;jab Cal with a&nbsp;hairpin. However, instead, Rose spits at&nbsp;her fiance’s face. The director approved of&nbsp;Winslet’s decision because earlier Jack was teaching Rose to&nbsp;spit and she managed to&nbsp;use the skill right away.</p><p><h2>The scene where Daniel Craig is&nbsp;coming out of&nbsp;the water was not in&nbsp;the script of&nbsp;<i>Casino Royale</i>. The actor simply wanted to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;swim.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/705/202/977c2352a4bb1cca113e8b8665.jpg><p>While shooting a&nbsp;scene on&nbsp;the beach, Daniel Craig decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fool around</a>. The actor pretended he&nbsp;was swimming in&nbsp;shallow waters and then suddenly got up&nbsp;and came out of&nbsp;the water. The shot turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very nice and eventually stayed in&nbsp;the flick. Additionally, some shots became the basis for the film’s promotional campaign and formed the updated image of&nbsp;James Bond.</p><p><h2>Mike Myers insisted on&nbsp;changing Shrek’s accent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7d/908/d9fed15052ab28668ef1465474.jpg><p>Mike Myers is&nbsp;the one who voiced the popular character, Shrek. He&nbsp;was doing it&nbsp;using his Canadian accent. However, after looking at&nbsp;the draft version, Myers decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change</a> his character’s accent to&nbsp;Scottish. It&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;the actor that Shrek belonged to&nbsp;the working class, which, according to&nbsp;Myers, sounds like this.</p><p>This decision cost the animators many additional hours of&nbsp;work and about an&nbsp;extra $5&nbsp;million. But all of&nbsp;the expenses <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paid off</a>&nbsp;— the producer of&nbsp;the cartoon, Steven Spielberg, stayed pleased and Shrek became one of&nbsp;the most famous Scottish characters in&nbsp;pop culture of&nbsp;the 21st century.</p><p><h2>Reese Witherspoon “rewrote” her character before the start of&nbsp;<i>Cruel Intentions.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b75/6ef/4241015c2f8059d6af6cc57008.jpg><p><a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon" data-link=tag>Reese Witherspoon</a> didn’t want to&nbsp;play Annette in<i>&nbsp;Cruel Intentions </i>because the actress didn’t like the girl’s character created by&nbsp;scriptwriters. Witherspoon considered Annette too shy and weak-willed. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked over</a> the character herself, rewrote several phrases, and eventually created a&nbsp;deep and multifaceted character.</p><p><h2>Jason Isaacs changed the appearance of&nbsp;his character, Lucius Malfoy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b2/a54/e4759653268c94fb5882115710.jpg><p>Initially, the costume designers of&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter </i>chose a&nbsp;striped suit and a&nbsp;black-and-white wig for Lucius Malfoy. The actor, Jason Isaacs, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refused</a> this look and offered to&nbsp;replace it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;wizard’s gown and long, white hair.</p><p>Later, the actor confessed that he&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;keep the hair as&nbsp;straight as&nbsp;possible and that’s why he&nbsp;was always throwing his head back. This added arrogance to&nbsp;his character, which became an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;Lucius Malfoy.</p><p><h2>Joaquin Phoenix got an&nbsp;idea to&nbsp;get into the fridge while shooting <i>Joker</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/e89/a7da6c5c85a97a59b1f0d1193f.jpg><p>While shooting the kitchen scene, Joaquin Phoenix suddenly started to&nbsp;empty the contents of&nbsp;the fridge and then <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got inside</a> it&nbsp;and shut the door. The film crew was surprised, but didn’t stop filming&nbsp;— Phoenix’s colleagues were intrigued to&nbsp;see what the actor would do&nbsp;next. This is&nbsp;how one of&nbsp;the most powerful moments of&nbsp;the flick was born.</p><p><h2>Samuel L. Jackson asked for a&nbsp;purple sword from the director when shooting S<i>tar Wars: Episode II&nbsp;— Attack of&nbsp;the Clones</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d77/702/67581754eb91f1c9083a5589f5.jpg><p>George Lucas set a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rule</a>: good guys get blue or&nbsp;green light swords, while bad guys get red ones. Samuel L. Jackson asked the director to&nbsp;provide his character, Mace Windu, with a&nbsp;light sword of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purple</a> color. According to&nbsp;the actor, this would help his character stand out from the crowd of&nbsp;warriors in&nbsp;the final of&nbsp;the flick S<i>tar Wars: Episode II&nbsp;— Attack of&nbsp;the Clones.</i> Lucas agreed, and Jackson was happy.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;the <i>Dumb and Dumber</i> movie, Jim Carrey’s phrase, “No&nbsp;way...that’s great. We’ve landed on&nbsp;the moon!” was improvised.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f1/ced/b785cb5dcb918212e6e1c8e67d.jpg><p>Jim Carrey often improvises on&nbsp;set, and the movie, <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>, was no&nbsp;exception. The scene where Lloyd is&nbsp;leaving a&nbsp;cafe and sees an&nbsp;old newspaper on&nbsp;the wall was not supposed to&nbsp;cause a&nbsp;strong <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reaction</a> in&nbsp;his character. However, Jim Carrey reacted to&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;expressively that the take ended up&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;the flick and became one of&nbsp;the funniest moments.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;<i>The Avengers</i>, Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. passed on&nbsp;his own habits to&nbsp;his character.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca3/09d/15c7825bf29e8dcfc065f73412.jpg><p>Ironman, played by&nbsp;Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr., inherited the actor’s love for snacks. For example, when he&nbsp;suddenly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appears</a> in&nbsp;the frame with a&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;snacks, he&nbsp;doesn’t get lost and gladly offers Hulk and Captain America to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;bite too.</p><p><h2>Bonus: It&nbsp;was David Schwimmer who came up&nbsp;with the slip of&nbsp;the tongue, “I&nbsp;Ross, take thee, Rachel.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65a/007/e6de7e5885b85f190d2843bc40.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us remember the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mistake</a> Ross made during his wedding with Emily. The scriptwriters were racking their brains about how to&nbsp;finish the fourth season. David Schwimmer helped them. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the episodes, the actor replaced the name Emily with Rachel, saying, “Rachel, the taxi’s here.” The series creators liked this mistake so&nbsp;much that they reproduced it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the final episode of&nbsp;the season, in&nbsp;the legendary wedding scene.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think actors can improvise when shooting flicks or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;better to&nbsp;strictly follow what the director says?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yedOipJ6rXZawtbvRrGSsrJWlvaawjJqumrFdm7%2BwuYytn55lo5i%2FqrzTZpinnF2ZtrOxwq2mq6tdqK6qsIytn5qso2KupMDUmqOlsV2lv6bA07JknKefoXp5fJNyanBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-margaret-university.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh | Scotland.org</span></a>
