When Punxsutawneyans gathered on a hilltop known as Gobbler’s Knob on this day, Feb. 2, in 1887, they did so not just to celebrate the weather-forecasting wizardry of the groundhog — the rodent was also on the menu.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Predicting the length of winter based upon whether or not an animal saw its shadow was nothing new to the German immigrants who settled Pennsylvania, although in the old country they relied more often on <a href=# rel=noopener>badgers and bears</a>. Europeans had long marked winter’s midpoint on Feb. 2 by celebrating Candlemas Day, a festival of lights that also included a formula for predicting the arrival of spring. <a href=# rel=noopener>As explained in an English folk song</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=31.5><p>If Candlemas be fair and bright,</p><p>Come, winter, have another flight;</p><p>If Candlemas brings clouds and rain,</p><p>Go winter, and come not again.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the same principle applied to Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney inserted the notoriously grumpy, burrow-dwelling rodent into the formula as a kind of meteorological middleman. It also became a regional delicacy, with a flavor described by locals as “<a href=# rel=noopener>a cross between pork and chicken</a>,” according to Pennsylvania historian Christopher R. Davis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the 1880s, per Davis, groundhog was the cuisine of choice at the Punxsutawney Elks Lodge. Devotees later formed the Groundhog Club, which hosted both the annual Groundhog Day ceremony and a summertime groundhog hunt followed by a picnic featuring a variety of groundhog dishes and a “groundhog punch” that sounds equally appetizing — a combination of vodka, milk, eggs, orange juice “and other ingredients,” Davis writes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As tastes changed and Punxsutawney Phil’s status rose, the Groundhog Club stopped hunting his brethren and began catering to him instead. Groundhog is no longer on the menu at the annual Groundhog Picnic, and “groundhog punch” has morphed into an “<a href=# rel=noopener>elixir of life</a>” that reportedly keeps Phil young and explains why the same groundhog has been predicting spring in Pennsylvania for over a century.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Members of today’s Groundhog Club claim that Phil — whom they <a href=# rel=noopener>call</a> “Seer of Seers” — is an infallible prognosticator, with a 100% accuracy rate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mathematically, that’s not exactly true. As of last year, Phil’s accuracy rate was in fact <a href=# rel=noopener>39%</a> — less than half that of New York City’s go-to groundhog, Staten Island Chuck, whose predictions have been correct 82% of the time. Although not quite the celebrity Phil has become, Chuck is arguably America’s most reliable shadow-seer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You can’t argue with a good product,” the Staten Island groundhog’s handler once <a href=#>told TIME</a>. “You want accurate readings, you go to Chuck.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more about Chuck, here on Time.com</strong>: <a href=# rel=noopener>Q&A with Groundhog Handler Doug Schwartz</a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Groundhog: An Appreciation</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/140202-groundhog-day.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read next: <a href=# rel=noopener>6 Things to Know About Groundhog Day</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen to the most important stories of the day.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbmhqhXqBjqCpqK2embWws4ydmLJlmJ7AtbvRsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-how-to-order-food-in-german.html><span>←</span><span>Here's how to order food in German</span></a>
