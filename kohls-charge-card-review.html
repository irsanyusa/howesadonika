While these cards usually have several benefits, they sometimes have high fees or other limitations.</p><p>The Kohl’s Charge Card is offered to Kohl’s customers, and it includes cash back, monthly free shipping, and other discounts. In this Kohl’s Charge Card review, we’ll see how this card stacks up and whether it’s worth adding to your wallet.</p><h2 id=times-take>TIME's Take</h2><p>The Kohl’s Charge Card earns 7.5% cash back on every purchase, plus 35% back on your first purchase. While that is enticing, you can earn 5% cash back by simply signing up for Kohl’s Rewards. The Kohl’s Charge Card offers some extra benefits, but its high APR makes it tough to recommend for all but the most intensely loyal Kohl’s customers.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-card-for>Who is the card for?</h2><p>The Kohl’s Card is perfect for frequent Kohl’s shoppers. It includes exclusive discounts, special offers, and promotions.</p><p>The Kohl’s Charge Card is also most suitable for those who pay off their balances every month. It has a variable 30.74% APR, which means that carrying a balance on this card is costly.</p><p>In some instances, this card could also be good for building credit. Because you can only use the card at Kohl’s stores, running up a balance is more difficult. If you spend small amounts on the card and pay it off every month, it can give your credit score a boost.</p><p>Whether this card is right for you depends on your finances, spending habits, and goals. In general, it’s best for those who can take full advantage of the card’s benefits.</p><h2 id=kohls-charge-card-review-summary-pros--cons>Kohl’s Charge Card review summary: pros & cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>High cash back rate on in-store purchases</li><li>Possible to stack Kohl’s Card discounts with Kohl’s Cash®</li><li>No membership fees</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>Can’t use outside Kohl’s stores</li><li>Regular APR is high</li><li>Can only redeem during redemption dates</li></ul><h2 id=rewards-structure>Rewards structure</h2><p>For the most part, the Kohl’s Charge Card has a simple rewards structure. Here’s what you can earn as a cardmember:</p><ul><li>7.5% cash back on every purchase.</li><li>35% off on your first purchase within 14 days of card approval.</li><li>$10 for every $50 spent during Kohl’s Cash earn periods.</li><li>Extra savings coupons</li><li>Receipt-free returns on purchases</li><li>Monthly free shipping opportunities</li></ul><p>You can also combine Kohl’s Card benefits with Kohl’s Cash. This means you can still earn Kohl’s Cash in addition to your other card benefits during earning periods. In other words, you can potentially get big savings by using your Kohl’s Card during special offers and promotions.</p><h2 id=additional-hidden-perks>Additional hidden perks</h2><p>There can also be hidden perks that come with the Kohl’s Charge Card. These are typically part of limited-time promotions and might include:</p><ul><li>Exclusive discounts, including percentage discounts on purchases or flat dollar-amount discounts on certain items or categories.</li><li>Special anniversary offers or discounts for cardmembers.</li><li>Bonus rewards or incentives for specific spending categories or items. These might include additional discounts, extra Kohl’s Cash, or other rewards.</li></ul><p>As mentioned, these hidden perks are often limited-time offers. Watch for mailers that include information about exclusive discounts and promotions.</p><h2 id=what-could-be-improved>What could be improved</h2><p>The most obvious area of improvement for this card is its limited usefulness—it can be used only in Kohl’s stores. While this is typical for a store credit card, it means you can’t use the card or earn cash back anywhere outside of Kohl’s stores or on Kohl’s.com. Redeeming Kohl’s Cash is even more limited, as you can only do so during redemption periods noted on the Kohl’s Cash Coupon or in the email you receive after shopping online or at the kiosk. Because of this, you may only be able to redeem Kohl’s Cash for a brief period.</p><p>This also means that the Kohl’s Charge Card doesn’t deliver the benefits of many other credit cards, such as the ability to transfer to travel partners. While it does include a welcome offer of 35% off your first purchase, that won’t be as lucrative as other welcome offers unless you spend a substantial amount. For example, to match the value of the $200 welcome offer on the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Flex(SM)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048224*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} href=#>card_name</a></span>, you would have to spend about $571 or more.</p><p>Lastly, the regular APR on this card is high at 30.74%. Carrying a balance on this card is costly. It would be nice to see an APR more in line with the alternatives listed in the next section.</p><h2 id=comparing-alternatives-to-kohls-charge-card>Comparing alternatives to Kohl’s Charge Card</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK"><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Kohl’s Charge Card</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Kohl’s customers</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>30.74% (variable)</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Flexible cash back</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*reg_apr,reg_apr_type*,*api*:*cc*}>reg_apr,reg_apr_type</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*annual_fees*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fees</span></span></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 bIxih"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Chase Freedom Unlimited(R)" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*3006090*,*field*:*credit_score_needed*,*api*:*cc*}>credit_score_needed</span></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom line</h2><p>The Kohl’s Charge Card offers 7.5% cash back on every purchase, a 35% discount on your first purchase, and other promotions and discounts. However, it has a high APR and can’t be used outside Kohl’s stores. It also lacks other benefits, such as free shipping.</p><p>This card may be a good choice for regular Kohl’s customers.
