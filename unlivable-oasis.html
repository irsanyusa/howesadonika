He felt like he’d fallen through a crack in the world. Life here had been hard for decades. And the climate crisis was making it harder. As temperatures rose, the power failed, and the arsenic levels in Oasis’s well water increased.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Less than 30 minutes away lay lush carpets of golf-course grass and shimmering blue pools, amenities to cool the more affluent residents of Palm Springs and the rest of the western Coachella Valley. Just a 10 minute drive from Nicolas’s mobile home was the Thermal Club, where millionaires lounged in multi-million-dollar villas and drove luxury race cars around a private racetrack.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Between this world and Oasis is what’s known as the “climate gap,” a literal gap in temperature and infrastructure, but also a gap in suffering due to the climate crisis. The harms of this crisis are disproportionately and increasingly borne by people of color and those in poverty. As the crisis grows, these gaps are growing—and becoming more glaring—across the United States and the world. In this short documentary, Nicolas works to close that gap—and he succeeds, in part. But this is just the beginning of an ongoing struggle to protect his family and his children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaGllhnd%2Bjq6lpaGmlq%2BtsYyomKyho2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./encadrement-des-loyers-en-ehpa-precisions-ministerielles-et-fortes-reserves-des-etablissements.html><span>←</span><span>prcisions ministrielles et fortes rserves des tablissements</span></a>
