This record of consistently high performance in public and private office cannot be altered by any malicious effort to use the auspices of a state legislature for defamation and undeserved smears.</p><p>“Many of the officials who served in the El-Rufai government appeared before the ad-hoc committee because of their confidence in the quality of their service and the rectitude which they served Kaduna State. They were under no illusion that they were participating in a fair process. It was obvious that the ad hoc committee was merely going through the motions of an inquiry just to give some gloss to predetermined conclusions.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“It is sad to see such a shameful departure from any notion of decency and fairness by a state legislature. We dismiss with contempt the claims being peddled in connection with the report.</p><p>“Malam El-Rufai wishes to assure discerning Nigerians that he has served Kaduna State with integrity and to the best of his capacity, assisted by a hardworking and patriotic team. He complied with all extant laws in all his activities while he was the governor. This jaundiced probe should be disregarded as the politically motivated hatchet job it is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy1tMisZKKrXaW8rbXTopqapJyueq6706KtmqyVmXqmuIyrrJ%2BZmWKxqr%2FMoqqsnaNiuKKw1KeYZpmjqLKursuyqmaooqSvpnvKqrChsapr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-diet-health-climate-impact.html><span>←</span><span>Scientists Rank The Healthiest Diets for You and the Planet</span></a>
