The parents to this talented soul were Robert Williams and Laurie Williams. The American stand-up comedian’s dad was a senior executive in Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury Division, whereas his mother was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi. The humour that Robin developed was attributed to him trying to make his mother laugh, to get her attention.</p><p class=align-left>Williams's friends from the Gorton Elementary School and Deer Path Junior High School recall him as a funny guy. He outlived his shyness once he joined the drama club department. The American comedian also excelled in school and even got elected as the class president. He later joined Claremont Men's College to study political science but dropped out. The choice he made was for an acting pursuit at College of Marin.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Actress Brett Somers bio: children, husband, death</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/09cbf012804faf0e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Matt James, the first Black 'Bachelor' 25 in 2021?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Taking care of each step of his career, Robin started as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a stand-up comedian</a> where he got critics of his work being simple.
