Consider keeping stockings, garters, and belts together (if they are sets), and consider using drawer dividers to house bras and underwear separately. Some people like to store special undergarments in mesh or other small bags.</p><h3>How should I wash my lingerie?</h3><p>Most lingerie should be hand-washed with gentle detergent, especially if it’s made from silk, satin, or lace. Let garments soak for up to 30 minutes and then rinse items thoroughly.</p><p>Many everyday bras and panties may be machine washable, preferably in a mesh laundry bag on delicate, and then (ideally) hang items dry. Always read the directions on the labels before tossing anything into a washing machine or dryer.</p><h3>What is the difference between lingerie and underwear?</h3><p>Underwear usually refers to the more functional undergarments like bras and bikini briefs and lingerie is usually casts a wider net to include not only bras and panties but also chemises, slips, stockings and suspenders, and pieces created with a specific aesthetic (often sexy, romantic or flirty).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnJ67qLHRopxmmqKWu6V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./4-fist-shapes-that-reveal-a-lot-about-your-personality-359660.html><span>←</span><span>4Fist Shapes That Reveal aLot About Your Personality</span></a>
