In&nbsp;2006&nbsp;he wasn’t searching for the love of&nbsp;his life&nbsp;— in&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;didn’t mind being single at&nbsp;the time, but life doesn’t always play by&nbsp;your rules.</p><p>While having fun with some friends in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bar one night, Matthew spotted an&nbsp;enchanting figure from the corner of&nbsp;his eye. He&nbsp;immediately knew that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;woman worth meeting, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;went over and asked her to&nbsp;join him at&nbsp;the table. Completely smitten with Camila, he&nbsp;spoke the ’’<a href=#>best Spanish of&nbsp;his life</a>’’ for the whole night with her while she spoke Portuguese. After this night, and their first date 3&nbsp;nights later, Matthew knew he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;dates with only her for the rest of&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>It’s a&nbsp;beautiful love story but it’s not always perfect.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t always have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;love at&nbsp;first sight for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;work. Camila’s side of&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;<a href=#>how they met</a> just proves it’s possible to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love gradually yet equally as&nbsp;hard.</p><p>When Camila was approached by&nbsp;a&nbsp;heavily bearded man in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Los Angeles bar that night, she didn’t even dream it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;her future husband. The Brazilian model didn’t recognize the famous actor at&nbsp;the time and wasn’t particularly interested. The moment she realized who he&nbsp;was, was the moment his close friend Lance Armstrong came to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her. The first thought that popped into her head was to&nbsp;run away to&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the room, far away from Matthew. It’s a&nbsp;good thing she didn’t because that was the night he&nbsp;won her over.</p><p><h2>They’re not your typical Hollywood couple.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cf/e8c/890f925966a632993e9f2d76ba.jpg><p>Before <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> was even on&nbsp;their minds, Matthew and Camila had <a href=#>2&nbsp;children</a>. In&nbsp;July 2008 the lovebirds had their first son, Levi, and in&nbsp;January 2010 they welcomed their daughter Vida into the world.</p><p>Their love for each other was certain, and Matthew knew he&nbsp;was ready for a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. What he&nbsp;didn’t know was if&nbsp;Camila was ready to&nbsp;accept his marriage proposal on&nbsp;Christmas Day, 2011. His whole family thought Camila was going to&nbsp;reject him. Luckily for Matthew, over the years she grew into the idea of&nbsp;marriage and said, ’’Yes’’!</p><p><h2>They perceive marriage as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adventure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/680/d2e/38d90550c8b53d622762c51fbf.jpg><p>The pair’s <a href=#>fairy-tale wedding</a> took place at&nbsp;their home in&nbsp;Austin, Texas on&nbsp;June 9th, 2012. The small Catholic ceremony was very special both for them and their children. Their son Levi served as&nbsp;the ring bearer and their daughter Vida was the flower girl.</p><p>Camila and Matthew are a&nbsp;perfect team and they came to&nbsp;the realization that marriage was not a&nbsp;destination, but an&nbsp;<a href=# title=adventure data-link=tag>adventure</a> they will enjoy together for the rest of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p><h2>The children are a&nbsp;blessing for this happy couple.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f1d/38d/ccd9ed50d898282ed420d994f8.jpg><p>Soon after the wedding, their <a href=#>second son, Livingston</a> was born and they couldn’t be&nbsp;happier. Matthew calls his children his ’’<a href=#>living legacy</a>’’ and if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him, he’d add 8&nbsp;more to&nbsp;their loving family! Of&nbsp;course, this ambition is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little far-fetched so, for now, they are perfectly happy raising their 3&nbsp;super-cute children.</p><p>Some may think there’s a&nbsp;secret behind having a&nbsp;successful marriage, but what this 14-year-long relationship teaches&nbsp;us is&nbsp;that love is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the little things.</p><p>Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves respect each other for who they really are and that’s what counts the most.</p><p>We&nbsp;could all take a&nbsp;page from this couple’s book of&nbsp;love, don’t you think? Share with&nbsp;us in&nbsp;the comments what a&nbsp;successful relationship means to&nbsp;you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOzu8xmqq2Zoqe2r7OMoqVmoJ%2BhubrDzqibrGWipLqiutOimmaln6u2pr%2BMraZmpJmrtq%2BzjKKlZqeemnqpsdGeqmalkanBqbHWZqScm5%2Bjrrazx56wZpmemXqkrcyio5plkaHDpr%2BMamtmsZWWv264zq%2BcZqKfqr%2BvsdhmbnJuZ2qEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./books-the-ill-made-knight.html><span>←</span><span>Books: The Ill-Made Knight | TIME</span></a>
