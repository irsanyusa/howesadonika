She thought it was a mosquito bite and tried homemade remedies but it didn't work.</p><p>Then, when I was one, my father noticed my left leg was a little longer than my right. I was bullied a lot in school, kids would spit on me and said I wore my dad's shoes. I also fell a lot and was eventually pulled out of school because the principal didn't want to take any chances with me - it was nerve-racking for my family.</p><p>In 2005, the National Institutes of Health gave me a pair of Croc shoes, which they thought were the best fit for me. They agreed to treat me and perform surgery on me - if I allowed them to use me for research about Proteus Syndrome.</p><p>I can bathe myself with the Crocs on, and I can manoeuvre around the house better with them on. Having the amputation would improve my life so much. It would help me walk again and I won't have to use a wheelchair anymore.</p><p>Five years ago, we asked doctors if amputation would be possible. I was ready for the surgery, but then met someone else who had their foot amputated, and it scared me seeing them walking on their knees. I was scared then - but last year I brought it up with doctors again."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>What is Proteus Syndrome?</p><p>Proteus syndrome, thought to affect only a few hundred people worldwide, results in bone overgrowth. The word 'Proteus' comes from the name of the ancient Greek god of change.</p><p>Overgrowth becomes apparent between the ages of 6 and 18 months and gets more severe with age. In people with Proteus syndrome, the pattern of overgrowth varies greatly but can affect almost any part of the body.</p><p>Watch the video here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ijop6VYrynec%2BaoKdlkaKys7XCmqVmpZGjeri106Fkq5mimnqku82doK2hn6N6o7HGrGSfp6Jiuaaz0marqGWSmnqkwdNmpp%2BeXZy%2ForzHoppon5qasLnAwg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2024-emmys-supporting-actor-drama-predictions.html><span>←</span><span>2024 Emmys Supporting Actor Drama Predictions</span></a>
