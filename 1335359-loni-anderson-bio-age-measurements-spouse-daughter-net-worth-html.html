It all started when she excellently displayed the role of Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom <i>WKRP in Cincinnati, </i>a role that won her an Emmy nomination.</p><p class=align-left>She later became a famous soap-styled fixture in mini-movies. All eyes were on her as she was determined to bring back the glossy platinum-blonde allure of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren.</p><p class=align-left>She was known as one of the stylish, highly appealing actresses whose hourglass figure and piled-on, bleached-blonde mane portrayed her as a woman with an enviable I.Q. She successfully managed to recreate the lives of such artificial sex sirens as Mansfield and Thelma Todd on television.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to that, she got bogged down in television-movie re-tellings of famous movie classics such as <i>Three Coins in the Fountain </i>in 1954, <i>Sorry, Wrong Number</i> in 1948, and <i>Leave Her to Heaven in </i>1945. Even so, her success in the films was almost hampered by the drama in her real life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0cdb2f826ec5e6b3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kathryn Drysdale bio: age, partner, net worth, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><h3>Filmography</h3><p class=align-left>Below are a few of the productions she has been a part of.
