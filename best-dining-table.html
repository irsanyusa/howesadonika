Sitting together around a dining table, though, adds a sense of occasion, and if you like to have guests over, it’s actually the most practical option, for the size alone. Below, you’ll find our picks for the best dining tables from our <a rel=alternate href=#>favorite online furniture stores</a>, and elsewhere.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-dining-table>What to consider when buying a dining table</h2><h3>Price</h3><p>When looking for a table on which to set your <a rel=alternate href=#>best dinnerware sets,</a> the first thing you’ll need to do is consider your budget. “Dining tables can vary significantly in price due to factors like brand, craftsmanship, materials, and design,” says Shawn Zar, furniture and seating expert at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Superior Seating</a>. “We all love a good deal, and with all this easy-to-assemble furniture popping up, who can resist? But it's really worth thinking about how much bang you're getting for your buck over the long run. It's not just about the immediate price, but also the table's lifespan.”</p><h3>Location</h3><p>“The spot where you're planning to place your dining table, whether in an open-plan area or next to distinct architectural features, can dictate its size, shape, and material,” says Zar. “For instance, tables in sunny spots might age faster due to UV rays. If your table's near a high-traffic area, you might want something more durable. In open spaces, choosing a table that's pleasing from all angles is a good idea, since it's on full display.”</p><h3>Materials</h3><p>When shopping for any kind of furniture, be it <a rel=alternate href=#>comfortable couches</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>sleeper sofas </a>or, yes, dining tables, what it’s made of is a huge factor to consider. “The table's material influences its durability, aesthetics, maintenance needs, and price,” explains Zar. “While wood offers a classic appeal, it reacts to environmental changes, like temperature and humidity. Glass, though modern and sleek, is a magnet for fingerprints. Metal, with its industrial charm, is sturdy but may lack the warmth you're aiming for. Marble and stone scream luxury, but they need a bit more love to maintain their look. And remember, even though that marble table might seem like the star of a magazine spread, if you've got kids, it could become a hub for unexpected 'art' and stains.”</p><h3>Use</h3><p>“Your table's primary function can be a guiding star,” concludes Zar. “If it's the mainstay for daily family dinners, you might lean toward a hard-wearing option. But if you're showcasing it during special events, perhaps aesthetics can take the driver’s seat. And if you're the host with the most, consider a versatile table that can accommodate both intimate dinners and big bashes.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-dining-tables>Our top picks for the best dining tables</h2><h3>Best splurge dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Herman Miller Eames Round Table</a></h3><p>For those happy to splash out a little on a dining table, Brad Smith, interior designer and CEO at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Omni Home Ideas</a>, suggests looking at this classic Eames round table from Herman Miller. Smith describes it as, “A timeless design with impeccable craftsmanship,” and since it’s available in a variety of sizes, with multiple options for both the table top and the base finish, it’ll go with just about any decor you have.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 30, 36, or 48 inches diameter x 28.5 inches high</li><li>Material: Walnut, white ash, or laminate top, aluminum or polished aluminum base</li><li>Seating capacity: 4-6</li><li>Shape: Round</li><li>Price on publish: $1,295-$1,610</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Lots of options for customization</li><li>Also available in rectangular or square shapes</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>On the expensive end for a smaller table</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A sleek, versatile table with enough options to suit any style of room.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Herman Miller Eames Round Table</h3></p><h3>Best budget dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Zinus Louis Modern Studio Collection Soho Dining Table</a></h3><p>At the other end of the pricing spectrum is this bench and table combo, recommended by Mariya Snisar, head of interior design at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Renowell</a>. “This sturdy set features black steel tubing and a neatly-done surface panel, boasting a rich, brown wood grain finish,” she says. A great space-saving option, both the benches fit neatly underneath the table so you don’t trip over them when not in use.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 48 inches x 30 inches x 29 inches</li><li>Material: Wood, steel</li><li>Seating capacity: 4</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $239.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Inexpensive</li><li>Easy to put together</li><li>Comes with benches</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Several customer reviews note various parts of the table arrived damaged or scratched</li><li>Bench seating may not be the most comfortable for some</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A cheap, compact option for those looking to save space and money.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best budget dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ZINUS Louis Modern Studio Collection Soho Dining Table with Two Benches (3 piece set) - Espresso</h3></p><h3>Best wood dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>West Elm Anderson Solid Wood Expandable Dining Table</a></h3><p>“This dining table is made of sustainably sourced wood, with a beautiful grain,” enthuses Smith. It features a clean, uncluttered design, modern, angular legs, and is crafted from solid acacia wood, but it’s the fact that it’s also extendable that makes this such a win. The two drop-in leaves allow for up to eight people to enjoy a meal, and should you be interested, it coordinates neatly with <a rel=nofollow href=#>West Elm’s Anderson dining bench</a> (although you’ll have to buy that separately).</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 40-90 inches (depending on number of leaves used) x 40 inches x 29.5 inches</li><li>Material: Solid acacia wood</li><li>Seating capacity: 4-8</li><li>Shape: Square or rectangular (depending on number of leaves used)</li><li>Price on publish: $1,399</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Extendable</li><li>Beautiful design</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews note the legs have the potential to wobble if not well maintained</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stylish and versatile dining table suitable for both small and larger groups.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best wood dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>West Elm Anderson Solid Wood Expandable Dining Table</h3></p><h3>Best value dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Castlery Seb Dining Table</a></h3><p>If you’re looking to get the most bang for your buck—or perhaps, the most table for your tender—then Castlery’s Seb dining table is for you. “A remarkable blend of style, craftsmanship, and value, this table becomes the star of any dining room,” says Artem Kropovinsky, an interior design expert and founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Arsight</a>, an award-winning interior design studio based in NYC. “Its timeless elegance promises years of admiration and hearty meals.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 59 inches x 31.4 inches x 29.5 inches</li><li>Material: Solid acacia wood</li><li>Seating capacity: 6</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $629</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Durable</li><li>Sturdy</li><li>Also available in a 71-inch length</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews note that the table’s finish is rougher (or “more distressed”) than they expected</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A simple, but elegant table that’ll stand the test of time.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best value dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Seb Dining Table, 71"</h3></p><h3>Best extendable dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Crate & Barrel Lakin Extendable Dining Table</a></h3><p>We’ve had a few excellent extending dining tables on our list already, but if extendability is your priority, the Crate and Barrel Lakin is Snisar’s top pick. Available in either teak or oak, and in three different size options, its wooden top has rustic farmhouse vibes, while its sturdy metal legs give it an air of industrial toughness. By adding the two leaves, it can seat up to ten people, so don’t skimp on the dinner party invitations.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 61-99/81-119/106-144 inches long (depending on size bought and number of leaves used) x 38 inches x 29.5 inches</li><li>Material: Teak or oak top, aluminum legs</li><li>Seating capacity: 6-10</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $1,999-$2,599</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Stylish design</li><li>Durable</li><li>Multiple size options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews complain of having to request a replacement after receiving a scratch or chipped model</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stylish, eye-catching table with the potential to seat up to ten people.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best extendable dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Crate & Barrel Lakin Extendable Dining Table</h3></p><h3>Best small dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Anthropologie Maja Dining Table</a></h3><p>Small doesn’t have to mean anonymous, and if you’re looking to create a visually appealing area in a small space, this might be the table for you. “Perfectly suited for compact spaces, this table is a testament that grandeur can come in small sizes,” says Kropovinsky. “It's where classic wood meets modern aesthetics.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 46 inches in diameter x 30 inches high</li><li>Material: Ash wood top, resin base</li><li>Seating capacity: 4</li><li>Shape: Round</li><li>Price on publish: $1,198</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Striking</li><li>Attractive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Very heavy for its size (130 pounds)</li><li>Expensive</li><li>Sculptural base does reduce leg room</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A small and certainly very heavy table, but with a striking look that will make the most out of a small space.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best small dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Maja Dining Table</h3></p><h3>Best small rectangular dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bette Metal Outdoor Dining Table</a></h3><p>Although Snisar’s pick for this category is sold as an outdoor table, there’s nothing to say you shouldn’t place it indoors, especially if you’re going for a more modern or colorful look. Made of sturdy, yet lightweight metal and available in four different colors—bright white, a more utilitarian gray, or striking shades of green or orange—it seats up to eight people.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 71 inches x 35 inches x 30 inches</li><li>Material: Aluminum</li><li>Seating capacity: 8</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $940</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Vivid colors</li><li>Easy to assemble</li><li>Durable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A little expensive for what it is</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An outdoor table that you’ll be happy to bring indoors for a more modern look.</p><h3>Best oval dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Crate & Barrel Panos Dining Table</a></h3><p>Can’t decide between round or rectangular? Split the difference! “This contemporary showstopper brings an artful touch to any dining space,” says Kropovinsky. “The unique leg design and oval top showcase the rich grain of the acacia wood.” Available in three different finishes—regular, sandy, or black—the table’s pleasingly curved legs continue the oval theme right down to the floor.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 94 inches x 42 inches x 30 inches</li><li>Material: Solid acacia wood</li><li>Seating capacity: 6</li><li>Shape: Oval</li><li>Price on publish: $1,399-$1,419 (depending on finish)</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sophisticated</li><li>Sculptural</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Needs to be kept out of direct sunlight</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A stunning table designed to be the centerpiece of any dining room.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best oval dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Crate & Barrel Panos Dining Table</h3></p><h3>Best farmhouse dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sand & Stable Amelia Dining Table</a></h3><p>When you think farmhouse table, you think chunky, wooden solidity, and that’s absolutely what you get here. “This is a rustic gem that exudes coastal farmhouse allure,” says Kropovinsky. “Its trestle base and decorative trim blend old-world charm with modern design elements.” Now all you need is a few goats and chickens to complete the effect.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 71.63 inches x 35.38 inches x 30.25 inches</li><li>Material: Solid and manufactured wood</li><li>Seating capacity: 8</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $590</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Relatively inexpensive</li><li>Rustic</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Use of manufactured wood might be off-putting to those looking for a classic, solid wood table</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A rustic-looking table that will look good just about anywhere.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best farmhouse dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Sand & Stable Amelia Dining Table</h3></p><h3>Best outdoor dining table: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Christopher Knight Home Della Acacia Wood Dining Table</a></h3><p>Eating outdoors doesn’t have to mean a rickety picnic bench, as this elegant dining table shows. Available in three different finishes—dark brown top with white legs, and gray or teak with rustic metal legs—it’s both weather- and water-resistant. “I love how this table combines acacia wood on the top and rustic metal finish on the legs for a contrast that enhances its overall appeal,” comments Snisar.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 69 inches x 32.25 inches x 29.5 inches</li><li>Material: Acacia wood top, metal legs</li><li>Seating capacity: 6</li><li>Shape: Rectangular</li><li>Price on publish: $269.49-$303.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Weather-resistant</li><li>Three finish options</li><li>Easy to assemble</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of reviews voice concerns about durability</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An outdoor dining table that looks good enough to use inside.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best outdoor dining table</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Christopher Knight Home Della Acacia Wood Dining Table</h3></p><h2 id=what-is-the-best-place-to-buy-a-dining-room-table>What is the best place to buy a dining room table?</h2><p>The short answer is, just about anywhere that sells furniture. “You can buy your dining table from various places such as established furniture stores, online retailers (popular ones include <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bed Bath & Beyond</a> [previously known as Overstock], <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wayfair</a>, and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Amazon</a>), custom furniture makers, home décor retailers (I love the likes of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pottery Barn</a>, Crate & Barrel, and IKEA), antique shops, estate sales and auctions, as well as local artisans and craftsmen,” says Snisar. “You could also buy from designer showrooms, thrift stores, and second-hand markets, and warehouse clubs such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>Costco</a>.”</p><p>“Your choice of venue largely depends on your priorities,” adds Zar. “Local furniture stores give you the tangible advantage—you can touch, feel, and visualize the table in your space. On the other hand, online platforms like Amazon or Wayfair offer a broader range, often at competitive prices, but lack that tactile experience. For those seeking uniqueness, custom furniture makers are invaluable, albeit often pricier. Vintage stores are a wildcard, potentially offering both value and distinctiveness.”</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-dining-tables>How we selected the best dining tables</h2><p>Our selections were made through consultations with our panel of experts, who have decades of interior design and furniture experience among them. We also conducted thorough research to ensure every table we included had mostly positive customer reviews.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What type of dining table is most durable?</h3><p>“A solid wood dining table, particularly those made from hardwoods like oak, maple, or walnut, tends to be the most durable option,” advises Snisar. “I love these tables for their longevity and ability to withstand everyday use and occasional impacts. On top of that, you can refinish them if they suffer minor scratches or wear over time.”</p><p>Kropovinsky agrees, adding that you should opt for tables with solid joinery, avoiding those that are merely glued or nailed together.</p><h3>How much should a good dining table cost?</h3><p>“Tables span a wide pricing spectrum,” warns Zar. “While budget tables ($100-$500) might suffice for temporary needs, mid-range ($500-$1,500) typically offer better longevity and design. High-end ones, starting at $1,500, often come with design premiums and superior craftsmanship.”</p><h3>What is the best wood for a dining table?</h3><p>“Typically, when it comes to choosing the best wood, hardwoods tend to be more robust and have a longer lifespan compared to softwoods,” says Snisar. “Common hardwoods utilized for wooden table tops in the United States include red oak, white oak, cherry, hard maple, and walnut.”</p><h3>How can you tell if a table is good quality?</h3><p>Kropovinsky suggests checking for the following to ensure you’re making a worthwhile investment:</p><ul><li>It feels sturdy, with no wobbles or creaks</li><li>The finish is smooth, uniform, and free from bubbles or rough patches</li><li>The joints are tight, and there's an attention to detail in areas like table edges and leg attachments</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llJ67qrrGZquampyafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./venezuela-work-play.html><span>←</span><span>VENEZUELA: Work &amp;amp; Play | TIME</span></a>
