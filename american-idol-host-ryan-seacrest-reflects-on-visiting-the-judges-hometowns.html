Seacrest reflected on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">visiting the judges’ hometowns</a> for this season’s auditions.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-seacrests-talks-visiting-american-idol-judges-hometowns>Ryan Seacrests Talks Visiting American Idol Judges’ Hometowns</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 22 of American Idol</a> is themed to hometowns, as the show traveled to where the judges got their start — Luke Bryan’s hometown of Leesburg, Georgia; Lionel Richie’s hometown of Tuskegee, Alabama; and Katy Perry’s hometown of Santa Barbara, California.</p><p>“Each of them took it very seriously, with a lot of pride, showing off their hometowns and where they came from,” Seacrest shared. “Everybody starts somewhere. It was nice to see where they went to school, who their teachers were before all of it.”</p><p>GMA shared a clip from the new season, showing the judges at Luke Bryan’s high school. Bryan can be seen telling his fellow judges that they’re standing on “the stage that I learned how to conquer stage fright.”</p><p>“When you think of Katy Perry, for example, she’s such a global superstar and icon,” Seacrest said. “To know that she would go to the farmer’s market in her hometown of Santa Barbara and sing for avocados and mangos as her payment, it just makes you feel like, what a great self-made story of success in the world of pop music.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KATY PERRY ANNOUNCES SHE’S LEAVING ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ AFTER THIS SEASON</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-seacrest-has-been-hosting-the-show-since-it-started>Seacrest Has Been Hosting the Show Since It Started</h2><p>Seacrest has been hosting Idol since it premiered on FOX back in 2002. As Seacrest shared on GMA, he was in his 20s at the time. The show has been on for so long that some of the new contestants weren’t even born when it premiered.</p><p>“These kids… their parents are younger than I am,” Seacrest admitted. The star, who is also set to start hosting Wheel of Fortune later this year, will be turning 50 in December.</p><p>Seacrest said he’s “so excited” to start hosting the iconic game show, adding, “I’ve been watching it for so many years, like many people here in this country. Pat Sajak is such a legend … I’ve had a chance to start shooting with Vanna [White] for a promo. She’s the most amazing person.”</p><p>You can watch the Season 22 premiere of American Idol on Sunday, February 18, on ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Original_TristonHarper_DisneyEric-McCandless-220x147.jpeg alt="15-Year-Old Singer Wows the Judges in ‘American Idol’ Early Release Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ryan seacrest</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2agn6jBbr7YmqVmq5WWsLOx0q1kq52WobKkwNJmpqdlpp7AqsDIp55mrJiaeqvBw6CcrGWYpLqmwM6wpaxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./transgender-bathroom-bill-male-predators-argument.html><span>←</span><span>Transgender Bathroom: Advocates Say 'Predator' Is Myth</span></a>
