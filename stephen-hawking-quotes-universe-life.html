He also offered insights on a whole range of subjects. Here are some of his most famous quotes:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On life</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.” Hawking gave this now-famous piece of advice to his three children Lucy, Robert and Tim and related it in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in 2010. Included in those words of advice were: “Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it.” And: “if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don’t throw it away.” <strong><br></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there’s life, there is <a href=# rel=noopener>hope</a>,” he told Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2006.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On living with a disability</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My advice to other <a href=# rel=noopener>disabled</a> people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn’t prevent you doing well, and don’t regret the things it interferes with. Don’t be disabled in spirit, as well as physically,” he told the New York Times in 2011. Hawking was frequently frank about his <a href=# rel=noopener>battle with ALS</a>, a degenerative neurological disease that often proves fatal. But he defied doctors expectations, living for over half a century after he was diagnosed in 1963, at the age of 21. The year before, he said in an introduction to the 2010 TV documentary series Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking: “Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind <a href=# rel=noopener>I am free.</a>”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On being diagnosed with ALS</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus,” he told the New York Times in 2004, after being asked how he <a href=# rel=noopener>kept his spirits up</a>. “Life would be tragic if it weren’t funny.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On being a celebrity</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The downside of my <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrity</a> is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without being recognized,” he told an Israeli journalist in 2006. “It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On the potential of humans</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something <a href=# rel=noopener>very special</a>,” Hawking told German paper Der Spiegel in 1988. He often spoke about space exploration and the extent of human potential.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-877190400.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On women</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They are a complete mystery,” he said in an interview with The New Scientist magazine in 2012, having confessed to having spent most of his 70th birthday thinking not about the wonders of the cosmos, but about <a href=# rel=noopener>women</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On religion</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason,” Hawking told ABC’s Diane Sawyer in 2010. “<a href=# rel=noopener>Science will win</a>, because it works.” But his work wasn’t all dry rationality. “Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and <a href=# rel=noopener>passion</a>,” he told PARADE magazine in 2010.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On the reason the universe exits</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason — for then we would know the mind of God,” he wrote in his 1988 bestseller ‘A Brief History of Time’.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On finding alien life</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Primitive life is relatively common, but that intelligent life is very rare. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth,” he said at an event <a href=# rel=noopener>honoring</a> the 50th anniversary of NASA at George Washington University in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-476665123.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On climate change</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet,” he said in an interview with The Telegraph in 2011. “But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.” In recent years, Hawking spoke and wrote about the dangers posed by <a href=# rel=noopener>climate change</a> and the frailties of planet Earth.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On Death</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first,” Hawking said in an interview with The Guardian in May 2011.<strong><br></strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWlthXV%2BjqyrnqiYmrtutMCwoqKml2K%2BtrvTnqpmrZ6ew6a%2B0p5kpaGWmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./projet-de-loi-justice-les-senateurs-rejettent-lidee-de-specialiser-les-tribunaux-de-grande-instance.html><span>←</span><span>les snateurs rejettent l'ide de spcialiser les tribunaux de grande instance</span></a>
