Here’s how many people speak Spanish as a mother tongue in each of those countries:</p><ul><li><strong>Argentina</strong>: 44.3 million&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bolivia:</strong> 7.3 million</li><li><strong>Chile</strong>: 17.5 million</li><li><strong>Colombia</strong>: 51 million</li><li><strong>Costa Rica</strong>: 5 million</li><li><strong>Cuba</strong>: 11.2 million</li><li><strong>Dominican Republic</strong>: 10.9 million</li><li><strong>Ecuador</strong>: 16.5 million</li><li><strong>El Salvador</strong>: 6.2 million</li><li><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong>: 1 million</li><li><strong>Guatemala</strong>: 11 million</li><li><strong>Honduras</strong>: 9.9 million</li><li><strong>Mexico</strong>: 116 million</li><li><strong>Nicaragua</strong>: 6.5 million</li><li><strong>Panama</strong>: 3 million</li><li><strong>Paraguay</strong>: 3.7 million</li><li><strong>Peru</strong>: 28.3 million</li><li><strong>Puerto Rico</strong>: 1.6 million</li><li><strong>Spain</strong>: 35 million</li><li><strong>Uruguay</strong>: 3.3 million</li><li><strong>Venezuela:</strong> 27 million</li></ul><p>On top of this, Spanish is partly spoken as a first language by residents of an additional 13 countries:</p><ul><li><strong>Andorra</strong>: 35,000</li><li><strong>Aruba</strong>: 15,000</li><li><strong>Belize</strong>: 184,000</li><li><strong>Canada</strong>: 497,000</li><li><strong>Caribbean Netherlands</strong>: 3,000</li><li><strong>Cayman Islands</strong>: 3,000</li><li><strong>Curaçao</strong>: 6,000</li><li><strong>Falkland Islands</strong>: 300</li><li><strong>France</strong>: 271,000</li><li><strong>Sweden</strong>: 62,000</li><li><strong>Switzerland</strong>: 96,000</li><li><strong>United States</strong>: 35.5 million</li><li><strong>Virgin Islands</strong>: 18,000</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-many-people-speak-Spanish-in-total?>How many people speak Spanish in total?</h2><p>In addition to the first-language speakers we mentioned above, if you include second-language speakers, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">close to 560 million people</a> speak Spanish worldwide. And, as you can see, Spanish isn’t only confined to Spain, Latin America and Mexico. In fact, if you combine first- and second-language speakers, the United States has the second-largest number of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico (somewhere close to 50 million people).&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-did-Spanish-spread?>How did Spanish spread?</h2><p>Up until the end of the 1400s, Spanish—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also known as Castilian</a> after the Castile region of Spain where Spanish originated—was spoken on the Iberian Peninsula (today’s Spain). With the explorers’ voyages that took place in the late 1400s and the 1500s, the language began to spread. Through the violent conquests of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés and Ferdinand Magellan, the Spanish language, as well as Christianity, was established in areas like Latin America (minus <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazil</a>) and Mexico.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-Spanish-developed-differently>How Spanish developed differently</h2><p>Latin American and Mexican Spanish are derived from Castilian; however, each region has its own distinct elements. Let’s have a look at a few of the interesting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">differences</a> in the way Latin American and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mexican Spanish</a> pronunciation evolved from the original Castilian dialect.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>/s/ vs. /th/</h3><p>One thing that’s common in Spain that differs in Mexico and Latin American countries is the use of a /th/ sound in place of an /s/ sound when pronouncing words that begin with a “z” or “c” followed by an “e” or “i.” For example, a Latin American Spanish speaker would pronounce “Barcelona” as “Barselona” whereas someone from Spain would say “Barthelona.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>/y/ vs. /sh/</h3><p>Another unique difference is that, in Spain, the “ll” sound is pronounced like a “y.” In a few other countries, such as Argentina, that same “ll” is pronounced more like “sh.” So, for instance, llamas would be pronounced “shamas” in Argentina.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Final sounds</h3><p>Some Latin American Spanish speakers also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drop the final sounds from words</a>. A word such as nosotros would sound like “nosotro” in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Venezuela, Chile and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Puerto Rico</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In some cases, Latin American speakers also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">omit the “d” sound</a> at the end of certain words or when it occurs between vowels. So, the word pescado would be pronounced “pescao.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Spanish: A worthwhile language to learn</h2><p>Now you know how many countries in the world speak Spanish. With such widespread use, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning Spanish</a> is a fantastic idea. You can visit all the countries that speak Spanish and experience the diverse array of Spanish-influenced places and cultures.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
