The group’s interpretation of the Bible. They believe that Christians should only commemorate the death of Jesus Christ, not birthdays.&nbsp; (See Genesis 40:20–22; Mark 6:21–29).</p><p>According to the group’s official site, “the Bible says that “the day of death is better than the day of birth.” (Ecclesiastes 7:1) By the end of his life on earth, Jesus had made a good name with God, making the day of his death more important than the day of his birth.—Hebrews 1:4.”</p><p>2. Birthdays have <a href=# id=7c86bdad-86c2-5373-a2b7-fb4b74e6366e>pagan origins</a>—History books have shown that birthdays originated from a belief that celebrations on this particular day would prevent bad things from happening to the celebrant. A book called ‘The Lore of Birthdays’&nbsp; adds that “birthday candles, in folk belief, are endowed with special magic for granting wishes.”</p><p><a href=# id=3f340bbf-f3a7-5d78-afa5-f56780b53f09>The origin of birthdays</a> is a major deterrent for the group. The official website writes, “The Bible, however, condemns the use of magic, divination, spiritism, or “anything like this.” (Deuteronomy 18:14; Galatians 5:19–21) In fact, one reason why God condemned the ancient city of Babylon was that its inhabitants practiced astrology, which is a form of divination. (Isaiah 47:11–15) Jehovah’s Witnesses are not preoccupied with the roots of every custom; yet when the Scriptures give such pointed indications, we do not ignore them.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3. Birthdays were never celebrated by the early Christians. According to <strong>The World Book Encyclopedia,</strong>“they considered the celebration of anyone’s birth to be a pagan custom.”</p><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses have chosen to follow their lead by not celebrating their birthdays too.</p><p>Note: This does not stop parents from celebrating their kids by giving them gifts. This is allowed, as long as it is not on their ‘birthdays.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8q7HHqK2aoKNixKrAzZ6qrJ2jYsSpxYyrnKWhl568tr%2BMoKmoraBisbCx0malqKxdmLKtscGrmK2dXZe2s8DHnZiyq1%2Bdxrt%2BxbOn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lifestyle-steve-carell-and-kristen-wiig-gave-us-an-incredible-golden-globes-moment.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig gave us an incredible Golden Globes moment</span></a>
