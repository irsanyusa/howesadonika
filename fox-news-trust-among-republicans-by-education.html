The first quarter of 2024 marks the first time in Morning Consult Brand Intelligence tracking that Republicans without a college degree are more likely to say they trust Fox News than college-educated Republicans.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This inversion along the so-called diploma divide came as former President Donald Trump — fueled by support from these Republicans, who make up an increasingly dominant share of the GOP electorate — effectively clinched his third Republican presidential nomination in eight years. Trump handily defeated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who ran strongest among GOP primary voters with at least a four-year degree. This victory came after Fox News saw drops in its net trust following three key events: 1) The fallout from the 2020 election, 2) the related Dominion defamation settlement and 3) host Tucker Carlson’s firing.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While Fox News’ decision in 2020 to project Trump’s loss in the battleground state of Arizona on election night caused more reputational damage among Republicans without a college degree, the aftermath of the Dominion settlement left a bigger mark with college-educated Republicans, eliminating the longstanding trust gap between the two groups.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trust in a network does not necessarily equal viewership, or in the parlance of our Brand Intelligence platform, “usage.” But in this case, educational polarization among Republicans is also having an impact on the latter.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In another first from Q1 2024, Republicans without a college degree are more likely than those with a higher level of educational attainment to say they use Fox News at least once a week.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-headline3 leading-headline3 mb-m"><strong>What it means</strong></h3><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fox News, like much of the Republican establishment, has tried to move on from Trump since 2020. Non-college-educated Republicans have made clear that he’s not going anywhere if they have anything to do with it. And while that’s certainly not harming Fox News’ ratings, the fallout from 2020, which ultimately resulted in a $787.5 million settlement paid to Dominion, has affected its bottom line.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If Fox News is increasingly beholden to these non-college-educated Republicans for its viewer base, it could find itself in a similar position as it did in late 2020, when it had to choose between telling its viewers the truth or what they wanted to hear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOn6axZZ6axLR506usrKxdlrqwusZmqZ6opZe5qq%2FAp6pmmqlisqXBwpqroqee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicolas-hulot-appelle-une-mobilisation-generale.html><span>←</span><span>Nicolas Hulot appelle une mobilisation gnrale</span></a>
