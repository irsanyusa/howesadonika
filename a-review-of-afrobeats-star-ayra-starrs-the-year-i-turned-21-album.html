 While the buzz that preceded the album release is a testament to careful planning and a consequence of Ayra Starr's status as one of Africa's most commercial artists, it also shows how strongly her music resonates with the average listener and her brand with a bigger audience."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Ayra Starr shares her experiences with love, heartbreak, loss, family, fame, success, and the good life while delivering music that excels in their different genre exploration.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>To love is to hurt, and these bittersweet experiences are conveyed on the groovy drums of the Swing record 'Goodbye' where she pairs up with one of the leaders of the Afrobeats' new school <strong>Asake</strong> to talk about the complexities of romantic relationships.</p><p>When she linked up with America's R&B heartthrob <strong>Giveon</strong>, it was to share a rejection of all things love after a painful heartbreak that she delicately documents on the stellar RnB track 'Last Heartbreak'.</p><p>A Sabi girl never says die, so even after the pain of heartbreak, Ayra Starr tries again. She shares the feeling of romantic love with the glee of a 21-year-old on 'Lagos Love Story' and the brilliant Afrobeats facing RnB record 'Rhythm & Blues'.</p><p>21-year-old with a critically acclaimed album under her belt, a multi-certified <a href=# id=b6acd850-6692-421e-9c26-f6a0bda950d5>Grammy-nominated hit single</a>, a global fan base, and a strikingly recognisable and bankable brand, <strong>Ayra</strong> <strong>Starr</strong> is setting the pace for female stars on the continent this is a role she embraces and relishes on her sophomore album.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the punchy up-tempo <strong>Rage</strong> produced tingling Afrobeats lamba (Nigerian pidgin English slang often used for bragging and painting an exaggerated narrative) driven party-starter 'Woman Commando' she invites Brazilian star <strong>Aniita</strong> and American sensation <strong>Coco Jones</strong> to join her craft an anthem for Sabi girls and women globally.</p><p>She boasts of her success in 'Commas' while telling off detractors on 'Bad Vibes' where she dazzles next to <strong>Seyi</strong> <strong>Vibez</strong>. On 'Control' Ayra Starr pays homage to global Colombian music star <strong>Shakira</strong> by interpolating a melody from her classic record 'Hip Don't Lie' feat <strong>Wyclef</strong> <strong>Jean</strong> while embracing her sensuality as a sex symbol for a generation of young women who want to be free and respected like their male counterparts.</p><p>While only 21 and 4 years into her career, <strong>Ayra</strong> <strong>Starr</strong> is a student of Nigerian music. On 'Sare' off her debut EP, she pays homage to the classics that shape part of her upbringing by sampling 'Orere Elegibo' by the iconic Nigerian siblings <strong>Lijadu</strong> <strong>Sisters</strong>. She shows an appreciation for indigenous Nigerian music on the Highlife record 'Orun' where she switches to Yoruba to deliver soothing melodies over groovy strings and drums on a song that showcases the versatility that holds up her claim that there's no one like her from this part.</p><p>On the delicious hit single in the waiting 'Jazzy's Song' she brilliantly interpolates melodies from <strong>Wande</strong> <strong>Coal</strong>'s 'You Bad' produced by <a href=# id=5dec58e7-6f1e-4c59-83fc-491d87bd0cf0>Mavin's CEO Don Jazzy </a>in a tribute to the <a href=# id=04e153ba-5443-4433-8b89-2a02609eedac>Afrobeats classic</a> and the legends behind it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While only 21, <strong>Ayra</strong> <strong>Starr</strong> has had her fair share of loss, heartbreak, and heavy scrutiny by morality police over her fashion choices. It's this reflection that delivers the very personal singles '1942' and 'The Kids Are Alright'. On '1942' she flexes her ensnaring vocals as she embraces the rewards of the sleepless nights on a record that features her brother <strong>Milar</strong> who has been by her side all the way. She closes the album on a victorious and moving note as she pays a glowing tribute to her late father who must be smiling down from the heavens. It's with this emotion that she embraces the love of family and friends while basking in the euphoria of being 21 with the world at her feet.</p><p>While some may consider Ayra Starr's decision to include 'Santa' her collaboration with <strong>Rvssian</strong> on the album a numbers-farming move, the song doesn't stick out. She also did dazzle on the song and it can be considered a necessary adjustment to the current realities of some to the metric that defines commercial success.</p><p>When placed next to <strong>Asake</strong> and <strong>Seyi</strong> <strong>Vibez</strong> who are two of the biggest artists of her generation, she not only held her own but also ran circles around them. The manner she guided <strong>Aniita</strong> and <strong>Coco</strong> <strong>Jones</strong> on 'Woman Commando' is also a marker of her superstar status.</p><p>Through balancing commercial appeal with a grounded desire to make good music that captures her essence and resonates with listeners, Ayra Starr has staked a strong claim for<a href=# id=c2fde687-c2b3-4df4-b556-5541c7181e24> Album of the Year</a>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In a male-dominated mainstream and at a time when numbers and hits shape the narrative, Ayra Starr is showing that not only does she have what it takes to compete but also the talent, range, drive, and panache to be the best.</p><p>On 'Bad Vibes' she says "Anyhow e be I dey play my part," the way this writer sees it, this is a part that's not easy to play, cosplay, or replicate.</p><p>Take a bow, Ayra Starr.</p><p><strong>Ratings: /10</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>• 0-1.9: Flop</p><p>• 2.0-3.9: Near fall</p><p>• 4.0-5.9: Average</p><p>• 6.0-7.9: Victory</p><p>• 8.0-10: Champion</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Pulse Rating: /10</strong></p><p>Album Sequencing: 1.9/2</p><p>Songwriting, Themes, and Delivery: 1.7/2</p><p>Production: 1.8/2</p><p>Enjoyability and Satisfaction: 1.8/2</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Execution: 1.9/2</p><p><strong>TOTAL - 9.1</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2Subr7Er6Cer12ks26txaumm52RqcBuv9OaqWaZqaeubr%2FTmqmrq12ptaZ52J6Yq2WZYsG2vs2em2ZqYWKura7UpmalaZ6vg6WE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12645-glastonbury-festival-fantasy-lineup.html><span>←</span><span>The statistically perfect Glastonbury line-up</span></a>
