Women have a sexuality, just like men have one.</p><p>"However, women decide for themselves when and how they want to be touched and when they don’t.</p><p>"Today, you have the chance to touch the box for thirty seconds and feel free. It doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man."</p><p>Recounting her experience with the police to Mirror Online, Moire said:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I was in Trafalgar Square and the police came and told me what I was doing was against the law and I had to come with them to the police station. I was there for 24 hours; first in one station then another with the court where I ended up having to pay a hefty fine.</p><p>"It was not nice to be in jail. I tried to explain to them the performance I was doing. The first detectives who interviewed me were women and they said they understood.&nbsp;But their chief constable did not."</p><p>Ms Moire went on to add that her treatment at the hands of the police highlights the different approaches in Europe.</p><p>"In Amsterdam it was very different - they are more free towards sexuality. But in London it was more strict - too strict I think. They don't understand this form of performance."</p><p>Moire claims that her performance at Trafalgar Square had been going well with a good turn before the police had crashed the show, arresting her.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"It was very interesting to see many women, who were there for a long time watching and seemed interested.&nbsp;I can't look around all the time - I have to concentrate because it could be dangerous for me.</p><p>"But I got the feeling people were interested. Then some mothers called the police I think because they felt offended.</p><p>"It won't stop me. It is a risk, but it is a risk I am willing to take."</p><p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said:</p><p>"Police were called to Trafalgar Square at 6:25pm on Sunday, June 5, after a member of the public complained about the behaviour of a woman in the area.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Officers arrived and arrested a man and woman on suspicion of outraging public decency."</p><p>The spokesman adds that Moire was charged with outraging public decency although the man was released with no further action.</p><p>See photos in gallery above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02igp2WcpLulu81mrqilkaN6or7RnqqtnZRirqfAxKtkmqScpMSqusZmqq2qkaO0pr7SZp2oppShsm60xKtkoqZdpcKjuMicZquanJmzscU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coronavirus-les-services-daide-domicile-vont-beneficier-de-la-diffusion-des-masques-de-protection.html><span>←</span><span>les services d'aide domicile vont bnficier de la diffusion des masques de protection</span></a>
