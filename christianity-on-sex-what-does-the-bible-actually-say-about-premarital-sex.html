Ephesians 5:3 says, “But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.”</p><p>3. 1 Corinthians 6:18 says, “Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.”</p><p>4. 1 Corinthians 7:2 says, “because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>5. 1 Corinthians 7:9 says, “But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.”</p><p>6. Hebrews 13:4 says, “Marriage is honourable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”</p><p>7. Acts 15:20 says, “but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from the blood.”</p><p>8. Colossians 3:5 says, “Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.”</p><p>9. Exodus 22:16–17 says, “If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price,&nbsp; and she shall be his wife. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Bible may not have explicitly said, ‘thou shalt not have sex before marriage,” but this definitely does not mean that it is permitted.</p><p>The fact that “sexual immorality” is denounced in about 25 passages in the New Testament is clear proof of where the scriptures stand on the matter.</p><p>P.S: “Sexual immorality” or “fornication” is the English translation for the Greek word porneia, which means “illicit sexual intercourse.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8pLTRoqqtoZGjtrXFjKilZquVrXq4tMCtZJ2nlah6tbTEZpmimpyaeqKv066YpaSpYsCixYyamaitpGK9s7HMmqmirJGherSx12htbq6gp8Cs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-loi-sur-le-sport-professionnel-definitivement-adoptee-la-place-des-collectivites-reste-en-debat.html><span>←</span><span>La loi sur le sport professionnel dfinitivement adopte, la place des collectivits reste en d</span></a>
