But global and regional audiences don’t buy the black and white paradigm. Instead, they appear able to be sympathetic toward Palestinian civilians, angry with Israel over civilian casualties, and wary of Iran risking a broader conflict all at the same time.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>special briefing</a>, we previously noted that global audiences’ increased support for Palestine and ire toward Israel did not coincide with greater favorability of Hamas. Similarly, our data now shows that higher average support for Palestine and lower average support for Israel globally has not translated into more favorable views of Iran.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This is also the case when assessed across several MENA countries where we survey. Not only is Iran consistently viewed unfavorably, but views of Hamas have declined in recent months, crossing into net negative territory in June 2024. Regional views of Iran are now roughly the same as they were right before Hamas’ attacks on Israel in October 2023, while views of Israel have dropped by roughly 20 points.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Comparing across our country-level survey data on views of both Hamas and Palestine — which we ask about instead of the Palestinian Authority to prime sentiment surrounding statehood more so than governance — two main things stand out: (1) a larger number of countries exhibit net favorable sentiment toward Palestine than toward Hamas; and (2) in all countries where the public holds net-positive views of Hamas, views of Palestine are consistently more favorable, with the gap especially pronounced for Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia. In a nod to their staying power, these trends held in our<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> May 2024 special briefing</a> and continue to hold today.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Views of Iran and Hamas are more similar than views of Iran and Palestine</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Netanyahu’s characterization of support for Palestine equating to support for Iran is true in that it certainly plays into Iran’s foreign policy to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>stoke</a> protests against Israel’s military actions in Gaza. But at the country level, sympathy for the Palestinians does <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>not coincide</a> with support for Iran’s regional influence. Instead, views of Iran country by country more closely resemble views of Hamas than they do views of Palestine.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But at least two outliers are worth noting in the context of rising regional conflict risk: Egypt and Saudi Arabia hold positive views of Hamas but solidly negative views of Iran, suggesting Iran’s regional power plays make it less popular in its near neighborhood. This contrasts with other countries with large Muslim populations that are further afield and thus geographically removed from the conflict — like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan — where public views of Iran are, to varying degrees, more favorable.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>Israel loses U.S. public support, but Netanyahu gets a bounce</strong></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As risks of a wider regional conflict move to the fore, Israel’s reputation remains solidly underwater in nearly all countries where we track public views of it on a daily basis (see Israel tab in chart above). U.S. views of Israel are just above neutral, marking their lowest point since we began tracking them in early 2021. Conversely, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose approval ratings were at all time lows from April-June 2024, has seen his support bounce since early July, putting him in striking range of his highest approval levels thus far in 2024. His address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on July 24 surely helped. Going forward, the assassination of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh may also assuage some domestic frustrations over intelligence failures which allowed for the Oct. 7 attacks, giving Netanyahu an additional boost. This is a dangerous dynamic, as it <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>incentivizes</a> Netanyahu to take actions he believes will aid his political survival, even if they escalate the conflict.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The likelihood and implications of a broader conflict</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Intensive diplomacy has managed to forestall a broadening of the conflict in recent months, and may well do so again. However, the likelihood of a wider conflict is higher now than at any time since just after the Oct. 7 attacks. Aside from the obvious human cost, a wider regional conflict would be net negative for global business, with <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>travel</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>supply chain</a> disruptions, as well as political instability, adding to the ongoing geopolitical polycrisis and roiling global markets.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A more overt Israel-Iran conflict, as opposed to the current shadow war, might however shift public perceptions, casting Israel once again in the role of a victim besieged by regional enemies rather than solely as an aggressor in a campaign with high civilian casualties. This, in turn, could cast the United States once more in the role of regional peacemaker, especially given Iran’s unpopularity among many of its Middle Eastern neighbors. These dynamics could ease some regional dissatisfaction with American support for Israel which, in recent months, has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>manifested</a> itself as heightened corporate risk in the form of boycotts of U.S. companies and calls for divestment from Israel.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In light of all of the downsides, this would be a pallid silver lining indeed. And companies should expect a softening of regional risks more so than a return to normal: Global average favorability toward America — which we have found to be <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>correlated</a> with views of U.S. companies — has fallen roughly 10 points since the conflict began, and would require a dramatic reversal to return these and other risks to pre-war levels.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5y5sK7ApaOyZaCqr621wmaqrqigpL%2B1ecWoqWaokaGytMDIp6CapqNisbCx0malqKxdmr62rdOeZK2nXajCsbzOq6tmnp%2Bneqq%2BwKc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-people-who-cheated-death-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale-460910.html><span>←</span><span>20People Who Cheated Death and Lived toTell the Tale</span></a>
