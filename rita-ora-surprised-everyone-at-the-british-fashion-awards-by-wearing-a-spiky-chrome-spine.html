Ora arrived on the red carpet wearing a sleek black gown with a plunging open back, revealing a jaw-dropping surprise accessory – a prosthetic chrome spine covering her entire back from neck to lower back.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rita-ora-wears-custom-made-chrome-spine-at-the-red-carpet-event>Rita Ora Wears Custom Made Chrome Spine at The Red Carpet Event</h2><p>As soon as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rita Ora</a> hit the red carpet, everyone noticed the most jaw dropping part of her outfit, metallic spikes protruding several inches from her back, resembling a futuristic porcupine or dinosaur plate armor. Ora shared behind-the-scenes footage of getting ready for the event, showing the process of having the heavy prosthetic spine fitted and secured to her body with adhesive.</p><p>It took a team of special effects artists over three hours to fully assemble the look before she headed to the star-studded awards ceremony.</p><p>“We went really simple on the dress because the spine is such a big part of the look,” Ora said.</p><p>The gown itself made history as the first ever Primark dress to grace the British Fashion Awards <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">red carpet</a>. Ora partnered with the brand to create and sell 500 replicas of the dress to fans, with all proceeds donated to Breast Cancer Now.</p><p>At last year’s Fashion Awards, she donned intricate scale-like facial prosthetics framing her eyes and turning her face into an exotic fish and human hybrid. This year, she upped the ante by incorporating the chrome body armor that turned heads at the red carpet.</p><p>The singer had heads turning and cameras flashing as she posed to highlight the spine’s intricate details with help from her husband Taika Waititi. The matching chrome spine and slicked-back hairstyle allowed the prosthetics on her back to really steal the spotlight of her overall look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-compare-rita-ora-s-look-to-godzilla>Fans Compare Rita Ora’s Look To Godzilla</h2><p>After stunning the crowd with her chrome spine at the 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Fashion Awards</a>, Ora garnered some unexpected comparisons to the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. Fans flocked to social media to point out the similarities between the spines adorning the singer’s back and Godzilla’s own prominent spinal fins.</p><p>“Godzilla vibezzz,” one fan tweeted.</p><p>“Ritazilla coming to destroy the fashion industry,” another wrote.</p><p>Other commentators dubbed her “Ritazilla” and “Godzora,” further cementing the popstar’s status as an honorary kaiju.</p><p>The timing of the comparisons is interesting, considering Godzilla’s surge back into pop culture relevancy thanks to the critically acclaimed new Japanese film Godzilla Minus One. A new trailer also recently dropped for the highly anticipated Godzilla vs Kong sequel.</p><p>While her team likely didn’t set out to intentionally channel a 350-foot radioactive lizard, Ora herself seemed delighted by the “Ritazilla” nickname. She even retweeted some of the fan art morphing her visage with Godzilla’s, calling the creations “amazing!”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_HayleyErbert_DerekHough_David-LivingstonWireImage.jpg alt="Derek Hough’s Wife Hayley Erbert “Is In Stable Condition” After Emergency Surgery" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570aKrmmWfp65uv9Srp6uho5qxbrHVnqmyp56aeqLAjK2fnmWSp7a1tdKhZJ%2BZo522sLqMmq6aqpSoeqPFjLCcmqqZo7RurYysp6KjqWKwqb7Oppxmq6Ceu6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./our-forefathers-smile-down-george-washingtons-personal-beer-recipe-will-be-recreated.html><span>←</span><span>Our Forefathers Smile Down: George Washingtons Personal Beer Recipe Will Be Recreated</span></a>
