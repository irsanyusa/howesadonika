Pichu is the pre-evolution of Pikachu and one of the prettiest of all time. It's a type you never want to evolve even if his evolution is much cuter.</p><p class=align-left>It is not only one of the most beautiful in the anime but also in games. Its final form is both elegant and adorable.</p><p class=align-left>Considered as a weaker kawaii pokemon than most of its type, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pichu remains extremely popular</a> due to its appearance.</p><p class=align-left>Both he and his baby form (Pichu) appear in <i>Super Smash Brothers,</i> putting their speedy electric attacks to good use.</p><h3>6.

Skitty</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c62d7c4af1f26c54.jpg><p class=align-left>With pink and cream-colored fur, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Skitty is an adorable</a> feline type.
