However some of&nbsp;these deals have special requirements, which is&nbsp;why people are not rushing to&nbsp;buy them. There’s a&nbsp;bonus for budget travelers at&nbsp;the end: an&nbsp;island for free!</p><p>We&nbsp;here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have put together 7&nbsp;amazing islands that you can get for less than $80,000.</p><p><h2>1. Piaçabuçu Islands, Brazil</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e64/280/8b2fe75dfea3d4868cc93147f2.jpg><p>You can become the owner of&nbsp;not one, but <a href=#>6&nbsp;islands</a>, with picturesque views and unique wildlife, located on&nbsp;San Francisco River in&nbsp;northeastern <a href=# title=Brazil data-link=tag>Brazil</a>, for just $79,500. The reason why nobody has grabbed them up&nbsp;yet is&nbsp;probably that they are technically not buying these islands as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;they are buying the right to&nbsp;use them for<a href=#> 99&nbsp;years</a>, and they will be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;some vague “small, yearly taxes.”</p><p><h2>2. Little Rocky Island, Canada</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b21/66d/3b55c55614ba1a2a039febf2b0.jpg><p>This 8-acre island with white sandy <a href=#>beaches</a>, well preserved nature, and pine forests is&nbsp;also <a href=#>sheltered</a> from storms and hurricanes by&nbsp;the neighboring islands. There’s no&nbsp;other property there, so&nbsp;you could be&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;build your own dream house. Its price is&nbsp;only $74,500, as&nbsp;for why it’s still for sale, maybe it’s because the <a href=# title=Canadian data-link=tag>Canadian</a> market is&nbsp;<a href=#>flooded</a> with private islands.</p><p><h2>3. Tillamook Island, USA</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99f/894/e7500d5d9ea34cfabb38f09fd2.jpg><p>Tillamook Island (also known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Terrible Tilly</a>) is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;island in&nbsp;the traditional sense, it’s a&nbsp;rock with a&nbsp;lighthouse off the coast of&nbsp;Oregon. The original cost of&nbsp;Tillamook Island, which was sold <a href=#>several times</a>, was $500,000, and now it’s dropped to&nbsp;$50,000, but the waves sweeping over the entire island and a&nbsp;history full of&nbsp;various <a href=#>legends</a>, myths, and even <a href=#>tragedies</a> (starting with an&nbsp;accident at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 19th century with the head of&nbsp;a&nbsp;surveyor expedition, mason <a href=#>John Trewavas</a>, who was hit by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>wave</a> and swept out to&nbsp;sea) scares off potential buyers.</p><p><h2>4. Chandler Island, USA</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/931/3b4/d449e75022997670235e42d7b8.jpg><p>Cahndler Island is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>1-acre</a> island with a&nbsp;view of&nbsp;picturesque Maine, you can buy for $39,999. There`s a&nbsp;small cabin on&nbsp;the island and you also can build your own house there. The only problem is&nbsp;that high tide is&nbsp;significant for the island&nbsp;— the water covers half of&nbsp;this already small piece of&nbsp;land.</p><p><h2>5. McGibbon Island, Canada</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/457/aea/1e7d7d56e7b1ce66aa80cf379a.jpg><p>A&nbsp;small <a href=#>undeveloped</a> island on&nbsp;St. Johns River, in&nbsp;New Brunswick, Canada is&nbsp;up&nbsp;for sale for less than $29,900. The only disadvantage is&nbsp;that every spring, flood waters cover the entire island, so&nbsp;you can`t really build anything there. During the other seasons the island is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great place for camping or&nbsp;kayaking.</p><p><h2>6. Sheep Lake Islands, Canada</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e75/3ee/a5daaa553cb8e5d9d3df2f0ed6.jpg><p>These small tree-covered islands surrounded by&nbsp;the crystal clear waters of&nbsp;Sheep Lake will certainly give you peace and joy, but probably not much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;— they are only 25&nbsp;miles from the closest fishing village, so&nbsp;there might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;visitors and the island might not be&nbsp;that private anymore. But if&nbsp;you’re ok&nbsp;with that, you can buy this island for $50,989.</p><p><h2>7. Fort Carroll, USA</h2></p><p>For just $31,500 you can become the owner of&nbsp;this historic<a href=#> artificial</a> private island, built in&nbsp;1848 to&nbsp;protect the city of&nbsp;Baltimore, on&nbsp;one condition&nbsp;— you have to&nbsp;restore the abandoned fort on&nbsp;it. Local businesses tried to&nbsp;renovate the island and turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;hotel, conference center, casino, and even a&nbsp;jail, but these attempts were unsuccessful. It’s an&nbsp;important conservation<a href=#> nesting site</a> for seagulls and herons, so&nbsp;you can’t start major construction work, since it&nbsp;can scare off the birds.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Maatsuyker Island, Australia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/390/5d7/5c262654db9f23a5d91bdcc79f.jpg><p>There’s an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;live completely rent free for 6&nbsp;months on&nbsp;this tiny island with <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>’s most southerly lighthouse off the coast of&nbsp;Tasmania&nbsp;— to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the <a href=#>Maatsuyker Island Caretaker Program</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;volunteer. Duties include weather readings, ocean observations, cleaning out storm water drains, lawnmowing, brush-cutting, etc. Volunteers can take up&nbsp;to<a href=#>&nbsp;716 pounds</a> (325&nbsp;kg) of&nbsp;food and clothing, and there is&nbsp;just one resupply trip during the 6-month stay.</p><p>Would you personally buy a&nbsp;getaway island for yourself?
