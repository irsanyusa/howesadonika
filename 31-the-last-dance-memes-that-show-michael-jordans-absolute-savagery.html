Hopefully you laugh as much at these as Michael Jordan did at the thought of Gary Payton getting the best of him.</p><p>Many have begun noticing the pattern of MJ's self motivation. Seems like there's no real way around, to be honest.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Opponent: Hi Michael Jordan: "That was all the motivation I needed." ------------- Opponent: Michael Jordan: "And that was all the motivation I needed."

The barista gave me a medium. I wanted a large. I was like, you think Im a medium? Me? A medium? That was all I needed to burn that city to the ground.

There was no way around this man's basketball wrath.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>some things we've learned about Michael Jordan don't taunt him, he will remember it forever and it will motivate him to destroy you don't *not* taunt him, it will allow him to create fictional taunts from you which will be even more effective at motivating him to destroy you Rodger Sherman (@rodger)</p><p>Gary Payton really thought he "took a toll" on Michael. Michael did not agree. "The Glove," he said after laughing quite a bit. "I had no problem with the glove. I had no problem with Gary Payton. I had a lot of other things on my mind." That last line, particularly, is incredible, directly after hearing how impassioned Payton sounded just a moment before. You cannot write comedy like this.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A lot of fun was had with this moment.</p><p>Michael Jordan watching Gary Payton talking about how tough he played MJ is my new favorite thing ever. <a href=# id=e116376f-b99d-38a6-a31c-550435bb1b58>pic.twitter.com/g309YxiUjC</a> Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Gary Payton: To guard MJ all i had to do was tire him out Michael Jordan: <a href=# id=005e3496-7c08-3a6e-a8c2-4fa7e2ef5bbb>pic.twitter.com/UojKMsQinV</a> ChiseledAdonis (@chiseledadonis)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>me when i realized Michael Jordan only agreed to be interviewed for this film so that we'd meme him doing other things than crying <a href=# id=a9cb3ab9-34ed-3fcc-a5bb-b71316d81059>pic.twitter.com/wSPZnfulbi</a> Jessica Smetana (@jessica_smetana) <a href=# id=d5f23f2f-1973-3d1a-a98c-9ed42be4f477>May 11, 2020</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Even other sports got in on it.</p><p>The latest episode also touched on Jordan's offseason workout before his first full season back (after his brief run playing baseball): filming Space Jam.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Make this free throw, ho.

ESPN's official SportsCenter account saw a late episode appearance by Reggie Miller (who said he wanted to be the one to take MJ down) and connected it to a movie about another gambler: <a href=# id=f88dae9f-fdba-3f77-a45d-e8b3fad91c29>Uncut Gems</a> .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>We even got a Major League shout out!</p><p>In an earlier episode, Jordan watched footage of Detroit Pistons legend Isiah Thomas talking about his own exclusion from the 1992 Olympics "Dream Team." Thomas is believed to have been excluded from this teamwhich also included the likes of Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and morebecause of his bad relationship with Jordan.</p><p>I dont know what went into that process. I met the criteria to be selected, but I wasnt.
