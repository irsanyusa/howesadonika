Fisher <a href=#>passed away in December 2016</a> after suffering a heart attack, but had reportedly already finished filming <a href=#>her scenes for Episode VIII</a> at the time of her death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Star Wars: The Last Jedi begins with the Leia-led Resistance making a mad dash to evade the encroaching forces of the First Order. Unfortunately, in the midst of their escape, Leia’s ship is hit by a blast that destroys its entire command center. For a few minutes, it seems as though that will be the last we see of her. But then Leia appears on-screen again, drifting through the galaxy. She reaches out her hand and — using <a href=# rel=noopener>her connection to the Force</a>— manages to fly through space back to the Resistance fleet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>John Boyega Is a Star of His Own Making</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The general is unconscious for the majority of the rest of The Last Jedi as she recovers from her ordeal. But, of course, at the Resistance’s greatest moment of need, she wakes up ready to command. Leia gets a heartwarming reunion with her twin brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) — or at least his Force projection — and seems to pass the torch of leadership to Poe (Oscar Isaac).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Leia’s final scene, she boards the Millennium Falcon with Rey (Daisy Ridley) — both seeming to know that Luke is gone — to fly off into the galaxy once again. When the credits roll, a dedication to the late Fisher appears on-screen: “In loving memory of our princess, Carrie Fisher.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although there were rumors that Fisher’s role in The Last Jedi would be changed to account for her absence in Episode IX, director Rian Johnson has said that he didn’t alter the movie at all. “I felt very strongly that we don’t try to change her performance,” he told the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a> in September. “We don’t adjust what happens to her in this movie. Emotionally, you can’t help recontextualize it, now that she’s gone. It’s almost eerie how there are scenes that have an emotional resonance and a meaning, especially now. She gives a beautiful and complete performance in this film.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Disney has also stated that there will be no <a href=#>computer-generated version of Leia</a> in Episode IX like there was in Rogue One. “We had to deal with tragedy at the end of 2016,” <a href=#>said Disney CEO Bob Iger</a> during a March talk at the University of Southern California. “Carrie appears throughout VIII. We are not changing VIII to deal with her passing. Her performance remains as it is in VIII. In Rogue One, we had some digital character. We are not doing that with Carrie.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We don’t have any intention of beginning a trend of re-creating actors who are gone,” Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy reiterated to <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> in May.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Considering Leia’s storyline was left pretty open-ended, it’s unclear how Episode IX director J.J. Abrams will deal with tying up the loose ends. All we can ask is that it does Fisher justice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGZqgHp%2BjqyrmqpdrK6zv4ytn55lnJbAtXnJnpuiZZOWv7O1xGadoquYmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./habiter-ici-construire-et-amenager-dans-un-parc-naturel-regional-0.html><span>←</span><span>Habiter ici - Construire et amnager dans un Parc naturel rgional</span></a>
