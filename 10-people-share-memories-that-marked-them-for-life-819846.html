In this article, 10 people open up about experiences that made a huge difference in their lives. Their stories, whether joyful or tough, offer a look into the powerful events that shape our lives.</p><p><h2>1.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e1/2ce/1ee4d75dd2ab241fd57770bced.jpg><p>When I was 12, my family was barely making ends meet, and I often felt like an outsider at school. I was always the only kid not invited to birthday parties, while everyone else flaunted brand-new clothes and cool toys.</p><p>One time, my classmate’s parents insisted he invite me to his lavish birthday party. When I arrived, I felt out of place in my old jeans and hand-me-down shirt. I tried to blend into a quiet corner, feeling invisible. Suddenly, a girl across the room pointed at me and shouted, "Hey, look at that kid over there!"</p><p>My heart dropped, but instead of teasing, she came over with a smile and said, "I noticed you don’t have a costume. Here’s an extra one I have." She handed me a colorful costume and a small bag of treats. Her kindness made me feel included and valued, turning an awkward night into a memorable experience of warmth and <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>.</p><p><h2>2.</h2></p><p>My parents always criticized random people we'd see on the street/at the mall/on TV, and I picked up that judgmental behavior. Once, my friend and I were walking in downtown and I made a comment like, "Look at all of those girls who have dyed blonde hair. They're so fake and superficial."</p><p>My friend called me out on that by saying, "Why do you care? They're grown adults, they can do whatever they want if it's not hurting anyone. Why does the color of their hair matter to you?"</p><p>Only later did I realize that I was so judgmental of myself was because I grew up with my parents criticizing me because they probably constantly criticized themselves as well. It feels good to break the cycle.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BrightNeonGirl / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>3.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7c/ced/0446c756eb827455f818f07a33.jpg><p>On one of my college internships, I was standing in a hard hat/reflective vest near a coworker at a drill site next to a high school. A teacher pointed at my coworker, and told some students, "That is why you go to college. You don't want to be standing out there making minimum wage like that guy."</p><p>My coworker was a structural engineering PhD with his own practice. We used to have Christmas parties at his mansion in the foothills. It makes me question my own perceptions about people I do not know.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Damien_3 / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>4.</h2></p><p>My husband and I were sitting on our porch holding hands and crying, just feeling overwhelmed because we were waiting to find out whether or not my tumor was cancerous. Our neighbor saw when he was coming home.</p><p>About half an hour later, he came over with some fresh baked cookies. He didn't even say anything, just smiled, handed them to us, and then went back home. Just thinking about that moment has me crying again. The tumor turned out benign!</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reflection_Secure / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>5.</h2></p><p>Friends don't let friends starve. I had a friend say that to me when I was without any food at all just due to circumstance, I wasn't doing anything wrong, I had moved and had some unforeseen expenses and was a min wage earner. I needed to last a week till I got paid.</p><p>When he found out, he came over with some basics and stuff like Kraft dinner and whatnot. He was like, look you're just in a bad spot, and you help people like that. He just asked that I pay it forward, and not be suckered in by irresponsible people.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Romaneccer / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>6.</h2></p><p>I was in maybe 4th grade and my parents just had my younger sister, so newborn focused. I went to my school lunch, opened my paper bag and unwrapped the foil holding my sandwich. There was nothing inside. It was actually just 2 slices of dry white slice bread, and I was sad.</p><p>Literally, my table mates all chipped in various components and made me the most amazing ham and cheese sandwich I’ve ever had. I’ve been chasing that dragon of a ham sandwich since, but I’m sure it was the response and not the ingredients that I loved.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>I_Am_The_Grapevine / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>7.</h2></p><p>I was homeless about ten years ago. And I got my things stolen. I had one night in Portland where I was very cold. I was shivering on a concrete bench.</p><p>Another homeless guy comes up to me. We talk for a while. And then he gives me a nylon shirt.</p><p>Not much. But he knew I was hurting by the cold. And he did that. I still have it. It saved me.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>treuchetfight / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>8.</h2></p><p>One miserable, wet slushy morning, my baby was sick, and we needed groceries, milk, and her prescription. I got the groceries and meds and as I shoved my cart through the sloppy parking lot, my jug of milk toppled onto the ground and exploded.</p><p>A woman saw me and picked the jug up for me and said, "You can go back in, and they will get you a new one," and I replied, "Thank you, but my baby is sick, and I just need to get her home," and started buckling her into her car seat and unloading the rest of my groceries.</p><p>Right as I was finishing up, the same lady came rushing out of the store and handed me a new jug of milk. I was so thankful, I was literally crying in the parking lot.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nevermindthetime / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>9.</h2></p><p>Back when I was a kid, I was racing to get home for my curfew. As I rode my push-bike as fast as I could, my front wheel hit some gravel and slid out from under me. I crashed heavily. A couple walking past went to a phone box and called a taxi.</p><p>They bundled me and my broken bike into the taxi, asked the driver how much to get me home and paid him. I don't know who these people were, or what compelled them to help me, but over 40 years on I'm still grateful to two complete strangers for getting me home that day.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>affordable_firepower / Reddit</a></p><p><h2>10.</h2></p><p>Last year my mom passed away, I was living with her and her primary caregiver – it was just us. A massive snowstorm hit, and I knew it would be bad, so I shoveled the night before and parked towards the end of the driveway, because I had work in the morning.</p><p>It didn't help, I woke up, and the snow was too heavy for me to lift. I basically formed a small enough path to squeeze my car out and went to work. Came home to a clean driveway; checked the security cameras and saw my neighbor with a snow blower spent the day cleaning everyone's driveways. Bought him a Timmies gift card as a thanks.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>SecretSerpents / Reddit</a></p><p>We’ve all had that eerie feeling of unease for no apparent reason. These <a href=#>10 people</a> faced experiences that might chill even the bravest among us. If you’re reading this at night, be warned: these stories are bound to make you check over your shoulder long after you’ve finished.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xec%2BepqmklWLAqa3RnmSmnZ2kv6qx0maroZmkYrqivsqem2asmJq6brLOq2SloZaaenl9mHFrb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-of-the-south-tv-review-1201797493.html><span>←</span><span>TV Review: Queen of the South</span></a>
