Later, though, with only about 10 minutes to go before the end, it was put on pause again while its star, Pussycat Dolls member Melody Thornton, attempted to sing the climactic song made famous in the movie by Whitney Houston, “I Will Always Love You,” over the sound of tuneless howling coming from audience members. Thornton’s mic was cut mid-song, the house lights came up and offenders were evicted — struggling against being pulled out by their shoulders, in video footage captured by attendees — and the show was officially called off.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Local police questioned the women who were thrown out. A statement said that “a decision about any further action will be made once the evidence has been reviewed.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Stories about the incident immediately began to be exchanged among patrons of the British theater scene, and soon internationally as well, as the most egregious examples yet of what some see as a growing scourge of rudeness and even aggressive behavior threatening the traditional decorum of the theater.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m new to the world of theatre. But sad and disappointed tonight at the state of some peoples arrogance and disrespect while at a show.</p><p>Completely ruined <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheBodyguard</a>, singing over the actors, to the point of them cancelling the show & police being called 🤦‍♂️😢 <a href=# rel=nofollow>#Manchester</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/6pacRPKdqs</a></p>— Karl Bradley (@KarlBradley_1) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 7, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Went to The Palace Theatre in Manchester to watch ‘The Bodyguard’ and a bunch of entitled pricks starting singing over the lead during the final song,” wrote @tashalou96 on Twitter. A riot broke out, the show was canceled and the police were called.” Wrote another user, @REDARMY1878: “Just been to watch ‘The Bodyguard’ at the Palace and a mini riot erupted during the big ending, show canceled, people being physically removed and fights in the aisles. All because you can’t sing along!!! Police at the scene!!! Utter madness.” Said @islandnites, “They’ve had to stop the show AGAIN during the finale because of people shouting out, screaming and being incredibly disruptive. Just unbelievably disrespectful to the actors. And they’re refusing to leave. This is horrendous. Never seen anything like it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The leading lady, Thornton, recorded a video message and posted it on her Instagram Stories shortly after taking her makeup off from the performance, telling disappointed patrons: “I respect that you paid your money, and i am so grateful to everyone who respects the people on stage who want to give you a beautiful show. For everything that happened tonight, I cant say, I don’t have all of the details. I just am very, very sorry that we couldn’t finish the show. i fought really hard. It feels awful.. … I thank everyone who was respectful of the performers and am very, very sorry for those who weren’t. I hope we see you soon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Audience audio and video tweeted from theatergoers captured the sound of the unwanted sing-along before the performance was halted, with growing murmuring over the disturbance and fed-up audience members saying “Shut up.” Footage of the women being pulled out from the front of the balcony was also shared.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rowdy audience members halted a performance of The Bodyguard musical in Manchester last night. More here: <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/WzPf9fR9pD</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/D6A9IYFk9a</a></p>— BBC North West (@BBCNWT) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 8, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ayden Callaghan, who plays the role made famous by Kevin Costner in the film version, tweeted: “Theatre pulled the show at the end tonight because of disgusting behaviour. We wanted to carry on but it had become a major incident. I’m really sorry to what was 99.9 per cent a brilliant audience that a few badly behaved individuals ruined it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although it had not gone this far before, the rudeness of audience sing-alongs on the national tour of “The Bodyguard” was not a phenomenon isolated to Manchester. It had already become such a problem that it was the stuff of social media warnings and news headlines. In early February, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Glasgow Live </a>reported that a standing engagement of the show in that city’s King’s Theatre beginning in late January had been subject to “people trying to ‘outsing’ the actors and ‘chatting’ during the show.” The theater posted an admonition on social media asking patrons to show “consideration” for others and warning: “Anti-social behaviour towards our staff or other customers will not be tolerated.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Behavior described by those who attended the Glasgow engagement appeared to be at least as bad as what happened in Manchester Friday, if not worse, including evictions, although shows were not halted. Among the comments excerpted by Glasgow Live: “It was ridiculous how inappropriate fully grown adults were behaving. Actively trying to outsing the professional actors. It was such a shame and I felt terrible for the on-stage professionals being wolf-whistled and boo-ed every second scene.” Wrote another: “There were people being loud, singing along when they shouldn’t have been, and getting up and down all the time. The thing that was a bit confusing though is why the staff removed a customer to let her back in and then have to remove her again but properly. Also, the show was still going at a moment that was very quiet/intense and you could hear the woman shouting in the stairs.” … “Stay at home with your Buckie Bottle and listen to Whitney if you can’t behave and just enjoy it like normal people.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This was last night at <a href=# rel=nofollow>@PalaceAndOpera</a> during <a href=# rel=nofollow>#bodyguard</a> .
