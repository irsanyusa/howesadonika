"That little nob right there is part of it," the doctor says. "It sticks up a little bit from there." She's right, it is quite a pronounced bump, especially with the close-up camera angle.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Okay, there we go," <a href=# id=47e989fb-595c-3e0c-a096-e3b557bd2fa9>Dr. Pimple Popper</a> says. "I'm just going to tug on you a bit and make sure I'm not hurting you." It's all hands on deck after that. Dr. Pimple Popper enlists an assistant and uses multiple tools for this delicate area. She squeezes with her fingers and holds onto the cyst with a pair of tweezers. "It's a pilar I think," the doctor says as she examines the area.</p><p>She wiggles and tugs with the tweezers. Then, out pops the little pilar cyst. One popaholic had a smart viewing strategy and commented, "I squinted my eyes waiting for it to pop!"</p><p>She pulls it out cleanly, all in one piece. "There you go, cute little friend," she said holding it up with her tweezer. Dr. Pimple Popper has an, um, interesting definition of cute and friend. "It's like a little ewok," Dr. Pimple Popper adds. Remember ewoks? They are the teddy bear lookalikes from Star Wars-and now, apparently, extracted pilar cysts according to Dr. Pimple Popper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOnalmqJmiva2xjKmmqaiVp3qrwdKtZKmnoKWypXnAZqeipJGneqTF0q1kqKZdlnq4u8yapaxlla6yrbXDZqCnZZ6axG7CyJ2cqGdmabh1f8%2Bv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1396565-top-20-ridiculously-cute-pokemon-time-generations-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top 20 ridiculously cute pokemon of all time across all generations</span></a>
