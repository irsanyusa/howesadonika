Although roadblocks were set up outside the town to prevent nonresidents from entering; hundreds of Palestinians turned out last week to greet Mayor Bassam Shaka’a, 49, who lost both his legs in a terrorist bombing attack in early June. As Shaka’a returned home from treatment in a Jordanian hospital, Arab women ululated in joy and defiance. Two men climbed atop Shaka’a’s ambulance and sacrificed a sheep on its roof. Some of the mayor’s followers soaked their hands in the animal’s blood. “We offer ourselves to you in blood and in spirit, O Bassam!” they cried.

He nonetheless warned American reporters that “the situation on the West Bank and in Gaza is more dangerous than at any time before, becausethe Israeli military government is taking a hard line against our people andinstitutions.” Tensions indeed remain high.
