Listen, they got to pay their mortgage. They got to pay a car payment.</p><p>Cohen <a href=# id=00578143-790b-3420-a3df-9ee3c9d01ca9>told</a> CBS News that he sees 10 to 20 federal employees at his pawn shop every day, thanks to the shutdown. On Monday, a worker sold him a prized van for $6,500.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Oh he loves this thing. You shouldve heard what he put into it. He put a satellite TV, a sound system and a sunroof back there, Cohen said. He told ABC7 he gives customers a lower interestratewhen he hears their shutdown stories.</p><p>Cohen is not the only pawn shop owner giving federal employees some sort of break. In Las Vegas, a pawn shop is offering zero interest loans to federal workers. Michael Mack, who owns the store, <a href=# id=0f6ef5a4-f081-3b1d-a14a-ac4889705001>told KTNV</a> that, before Christmas, a few furloughed workers needed help buying presents and groceries.</p><p>"It's really unfortunate that it's that many hardworking individuals who work for our government that possibly have been affected by this government shutdown, and during the holidays especially," he said. "We had two different individuals who wanted to go out for New Years Eve who thought that wasn't a possibility. They didn't get that paycheck ... They got a loan and gave them the opportunity. You have to bring an item still of value get a pawn, but we charge no interest as long as you pay it back within 30 days."</p><p>In Kansas, a pawn shop owner anticipating a higher demand for loans coming from furloughed employees <a href=# id=d57a5176-98d2-34a1-ab86-b98ed23faca5>told KWCH12</a> his store will offer payday loans with zero interest. Employees will have to pay these loans the day they receive their first post-shutdown paycheck.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Visiting pawn shops is just one of the measures federal employees have been forced to turn to as we approach the end of the first month of the shutdown. Other workers have <a href=# id=61bcb55b-800c-38bf-a004-ca5c733faa27>started</a> GoFundMe campaigns to raise money for bills or picked up extra shifts at secondary jobs. Meanwhile, some <a href=# id=78069446-505a-390f-abbb-06eb69fedb2a>government organizations</a> have <a href=# id=4b251020-ff94-3630-ac73-b4e2f76e3fbd>shared</a> controversial tips for workers looking to make extra money.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=64656517-1071-3522-a661-98abdb82177e>https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-guard-tells-families-struggling-from-shutdown-to-try-dog-walking-2019-1</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwwMeeZKCnppq%2Fr7nEp6tmq5iqwaW71qdkoZmjYsCwucRmna6qnKTCqLTEnWSfnZSav6K4jJ6kqaSfrrKmv4ytrKummaO0bsDOZqear55iwKm7z6xmnmyjorGkwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./accent-study-american-actors-british-accents-babbel-1201998021.html><span>←</span><span>Study Ranks American Actors British Accents and Vice Versa</span></a>
