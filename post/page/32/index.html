The polling took place after Murray won his first round match at Wimbledon against Germany’s Benjamin Becker in straight sets.
While this 53% is lower than when YouGov first asked the question two and a half years ago, the polling appears to mostly contradict what many have claimed about British attitudes towards the tennis star – namely, that to non-Scottish Britons he is "</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/31/>← Prev Page</a>
