If you want specifics: "So, over a casual lunch of chicken tacos and my ever-burgeoning bump, I asked Michelle if she would help me with this secret project," the Duchess wrote.</p><p>So yeah, HRH hasnt been keeping things 100-percent plant-based. Or, at least, she hasn't while pregnant with Archiethough WH already suspected this. Despite Meghan describing her diet as sometimes plant-based in a 2016 interview with <a href=# id=b8de23cd-1731-3936-aefd-914963e87d73>Best Health</a> , saying, "When Im filming, Im conscious of what I eat. I try to eat vegan during the week and then have a little bit more flexibility with what I dig into on the weekends," it didnt sound like shed fully restricted her diet to meatless and dairy-free stuff.</p><p>And when WH asked Julieanna Hever, RD, author of <a href=# id=3ced6ef8-b956-3240-a1f1-98b3a6f35654>Plant-Based Nutrition (Idiot's Guide)</a> to weigh in and share whether she thought Meghan nixed all animal-sourced products from her life, she agreed. An unconvinced Hever said, " Meghans version could fall into the category of a more plant-based diet, or even more accurately, a flexitarian diet."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Still need convincing? Well, there's the fact that Meghan literally told everyone Harry popped the question over a <a href=# id=6e20723f-5888-3408-a0b0-2e45eb8fe66b>roast chicken dinner</a> back in 2017, and she probs didnt celebrate her engagement on an empty stomach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOppygoJGjeq6t0aSjnmWWnruiuMuyZJqclKeytL%2FEnWStoJ%2Bosm6%2B1Kamq6tdlq%2BwwdNmn56qXZeyqrrGZq2en5GjfLTEyWpwnrA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mayorkun-is-shocked-that-bujus-name-is-daniel-benson.html><span>←</span><span>Mayorkun is shocked that Buju's name is Daniel Benson</span></a>
