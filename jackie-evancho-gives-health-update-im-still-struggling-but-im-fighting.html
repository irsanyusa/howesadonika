The 22 year old is on the path to health after struggling with an eating disorder for seven years.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jackie Evancho Reveals That She Has The Bones of an 80 Year Old</h2><p>America’s Got Talent alum Jackie Evancho has once again opened up about her eating disorder. The popular singer recently revealed her diagnosis following her January 2021 car accident. While in the hospital, Evancho found out that her injuries were uncommon.</p><p>“They were abnormal breaks, breaks that you see in 80-year-olds,” she told <a href=#>People</a>. “That’s how I learned that my eating problems created osteoporosis. So now I’m a 22-year-old with osteoporosis.”</p><p>Reportedly, Evancho didn’t address her eating problems after being diagnosed with osteoporosis. Instead, the singer had to eat more to heal her bones, stating “that really messed me up with my eating problems, because I was gaining weight to heal.”</p><p>Once her bones were healed, her eating disorder took over once again. In October 2021, she sought out eating disorder treatment at an inpatient facility.</p><p>Evancho’s battle with anorexia began around the age of 15, while she was going through puberty. Since her body was changing, she decided to “start to mildly diet and start working out regularly” to maintain her slim figure. When she didn’t see the results she wanted, she began eating less and working out more.</p><p>Evancho originally seeked outpatient treatment at the age of 17, but continued to struggle throughout her adult years. According to the singer, the coronavirus pandemic made her eating disorder worse because “there weren’t distractions.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jackie-evancho-is-still-battling-anorexia>Jackie Evancho is Still Battling Anorexia</h2><p>In present day, Evancho is still working her way toward a healthy lifestyle. Reportedly, she is seeing a nutritionist and therapist. She also undergoes eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (a type of psychotherapy used to help her process trauma and get her eating disorder under control) to help throughout the journey.</p><p>At this time, Evancho has stated that she’s struggling, but fighting her way through. She doesn’t consider herself as healthy just yet, but she is implementing healthy skills and eating habits.</p><p>“Since I was a kid I’ve put so much blood, sweat and tears into my career, and to see that sort of fade away because of this demon in my head? No, I’m going to fight this now because you can’t take this one thing from me,” she said.</p><p>Evancho has recently returned to music with the release of “<a href=#>Both Sides Now</a>” by Joni Mitchell. Since releasing this comeback tune, the 22 year old has announced an upcoming show on July 24.</p><p>Her next album, Carousel of Time drops this September. This album includes multiple Joni Mitchell covers. Her next single “A Case of You” off Carousel of Time releases on July 13, it is currently available for <a href=#>preorder</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Since returning to music, she has been working on original songs. She recently took a songwriting trip to Nashville, which “wasn’t healing, but it was making something beautiful out of something painful.” The singer acknowledged that there are still daily issues, but things are getting better.</p><p>“There are days where I feel helpless and hopeless, but I’m sick of living like this,” she said.</p><p>America’s Got Talent fans remember Evancho as the runner up of season five, where she gained national recognition as a 10 year old opera singer. Since appearing on AGT, she’s returned for AGT: The Champions and competed on The Masked Singer.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LeahMarlene_MaddiePoppe.png alt="‘American Idol’ Winner Maddie Poppe to Perform with Leah Marlene, Fritz Hager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZqapKGVYrK3rc2cn6hll57Dpr%2BMoZyapKSdera8w5qrnmWZonq0wMilo2arpKfCqLPLoqWgZZKqwW61zGadop%2BYqbavs44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yeezy-gap-engineered-by-balenciaga-collection-how-to-buy-online-1235321969.html><span>←</span><span>The Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga Collection Has Arrived: Heres How to Get Your Hands</span></a>
