This also meant that he&nbsp;and his family faced unkind treatment while he&nbsp;was growing&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>His time in&nbsp;the circus wasn’t ideal. As&nbsp;attractions, he&nbsp;and his cousins were kept away so&nbsp;people on&nbsp;the street wouldn’t see them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a91/c4c/0807de5adeb2e443aab3c5220c.jpg><p>Aceves’s relatives were rejected by&nbsp;the residents in&nbsp;the small Mexican town of&nbsp;Loreto, and Aceves himself faced hardships from other kids. They would call him names and pull at&nbsp;his hair, making his childhood difficult.</p><p>In&nbsp;the film Chuy, The Wolf Man, directed by&nbsp;Eva Arid and translated by&nbsp;the BBC, Jesus Aceves, known as&nbsp;Chuy, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that the circus wasn’t a&nbsp;bad place where money was earned through wrongdoing. From his perspective as&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist, he&nbsp;saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;decent job, entertaining people and making them laugh.</p><p>Upon returning to&nbsp;his hometown after years of&nbsp;traveling with various circuses, known as&nbsp;“The Wolf Man,” Aceves settled down with his wife, three daughters, and extended family in&nbsp;Loreto. He&nbsp;commuted between the United States and Loreto for a&nbsp;while, performing in&nbsp;the circus to&nbsp;support his family financially.</p><p><h2>Unfortunately, his children, especially his oldest daughter Karla, faced discrimination similar to&nbsp;what he&nbsp;endured as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef1/400/9093805db4b4660744881a07f2.jpg><p>Karla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> her experience: “Sometimes kids will say things that offend me&nbsp;because sometimes adults will put things in&nbsp;children’s heads. They call me&nbsp;names and even tell their kids not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends.”</p><p>When Aceves decided to&nbsp;transition away from circus work, finding a&nbsp;conventional job proved challenging due to&nbsp;societal perceptions of&nbsp;his appearance. Despite his wife’s temporary employment, supporting the family financially became difficult. To&nbsp;increase his job prospects, Aceves, who had always avoided shaving his face, decided to&nbsp;take that step.</p><p><h2>Aceves and his wife believed this step would enhance his job prospects despite the challenges.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2bc/17c/b583525f26bc3527c4c5425569.png><p>After shaving, he&nbsp;attended multiple job interviews with optimism about securing employment. He&nbsp;also acknowledged that maintaining a&nbsp;shaved face would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;continuous requirement for any job he&nbsp;obtained.</p><p>While society tends to&nbsp;judge women more harshly for excessive body hair, Aceves’s wife viewed their family’s condition positively. She saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;blessing and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “...for me, it&nbsp;has been a&nbsp;blessing to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;daughter like this. I&nbsp;don’t think it’s a&nbsp;curse. Quite the opposite. It’s a&nbsp;blessing for whoever has hair.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/56a/def/03cff9505d88b1f33b0c07085b.png><p>In&nbsp;contrast to&nbsp;societal norms, Karla embraced her condition, attempting to&nbsp;remove her hair at&nbsp;one point but accepting that it&nbsp;would grow back.
