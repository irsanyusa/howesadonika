The clip depicts the various letters that make up the show’s title coming together on stage. Each one is modeled after a costume on the show.</p><p>You might recognize past winners such as Monster (T-Pain), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harp (Amber Riley)</a>, and Queen of Hearts (Jewel). Can you recognize the rest? It looks like some of them might be previews of Season 10 costumes. Any guesses what they might be?</p><p>One of the mystery costumes definitely looks like a frosted donut. Another one appears to have flower petals like a rose. There’s also a flying letter that looks like it could be a moth. We’ll have to wait and see what their official names are.</p><p>In a statement, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FOX said</a> that that the milestone 10th season of the show will feature “the biggest and boldest costumes in the show’s history – with the buzziest and brightest celebrities underneath.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER,’ ‘I CAN SEE YOUR VOICE’ RENEWED FOR ANOTHER SEASON</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-the-panelists-be-back-this-season>Will the Panelists Be Back This Season?</h2><p>If you were worried about whether all of the show’s panelists will be back for Season 10, you can rest easy. FOX has confirmed that Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger will once again sit on the panel. Nick Cannon will also return as host.</p><p>Jeong has already shared his excitement for Season 10, as he responded to the show’s Instagram announcement with a GIF of himself jumping up and down and shouting, “Take it off!”</p><p>Fans can also see Jeong this fall on his other show, I Can See Your Voice, which also got a premiere date on Tuesday. It was announced that Season 3 will debut on FOX on Tuesday, September 19.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_MichaelGrimm_PiersMorgan_SharonOsbourne_HowieMandel_Trae-PattonNBCNBCU-Photo-Bank-220x147.jpeg alt="‘AGT’ Winner Michael Grimm Is in Recovery Following Health Scare" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6tLHArKanZWFlerCyxaKaopmcocZutMCsZJploKeyrrXEq5xmnJGpsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-are-the-voice-singers-crossing-over-to-american-idol.html><span>←</span><span>Why Are 'The Voice' Singers Crossing Over to 'American Idol'?</span></a>
