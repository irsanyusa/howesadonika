And all the while you’re praying you won’t accidentally spill any nail polish, which can turn even the simple task of touching up your nails into a cleaning nightmare. The teeniest drop of spilled polish on your clothes, sheets, or floor can have you racing to Google "how do you remove nail polish?!?" faster than you can say "quick dry."</p><p>If your bottle tips or brush drips, there’s no need to cry over spilled polish just yet. But you do need to act fast—especially if you want to save that favorite pair of jeans or brand-new bedspread. "When a mani results in a nail polish spill, it’s best to act swiftly to effectively treat this stubborn stain," say <strong>Gwen Whiting</strong> and <strong>Lindsey Boyd</strong>, co-founders of <strong>The Laundress</strong>.</p><p>As much as you might want to scream, don't panic. We went to the cleaning experts to create a guide to removing rogue nail polish. Deep breaths. We've got you covered like a no-chip topcoat:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>How to remove nail polish from your favorite fabrics</h3></p><p>Whether you've spilled on your clothing or bed, the process for removing a nail polish stain is the same as long as you can throw the fabric in the washing machine. The first thing you want to do is lay the item flat (put a cloth between the stain and any other surface to prevent the spilled polish from spreading). "If the stain is still wet, carefully dab away any excess nail polish with your lint-free cleaning cloth," say Whiting and Boyd. "Do not use paper towels, sponges, or fuzzy towels, as they may leave lint or residue behind."</p><p>Next, you'll want to create a paste using a stain-removing detergent and a powdered all-purpose bleach alternative. Work that powerful stain-fighting paste into the fabric using your fingers or a bristled stain brush.</p><p>If the stain is still sticking around, fill a sink with warm water and add a small amount of bleach alternative, then let the stained item soak for 30 minutes. Then, remove and rinse with cold water. Repeat until the stain is gone, then toss the fabric into a regular wash cycle.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>How to remove nail polish from carpet or your couch</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So what do you do when you can't throw the item in the washer—like if you spill on the carpet or your couch? The process is actually pretty similar, according to Whiting and Boyd.</p><p>Just like with a pair of jeans or cotton tee, use a lint-free cloth to remove any extra polish and then go after the stain with a combo of stain-removing soap and bleach alternative, making a paste to scrub at the polish spot. "Once the stain is lifted, wet a lint-free cleaning cloth in warm water and dampen the area to remove the soap suds completely," say Whiting and Boyd. Then use your cloth to dry the area.</p><p>If you spill on your counter, hardwood floors, or bathroom tile, you can't exactly suds the stain away. But that doesn't mean you're stuck with a Jackson Pollock on your hardwood. Step one: Bust out your handy lint-free cloth to remove any excess polish. Step 2: "Use a cotton swab soaked with non-acetone nail polish to gently remove the stain," according to Whiting and Boyd. The key here is to be delicate and go slowly and lightly—dousing the stain with nail polish remover can remove the finish on your floors. Just like removing polish from fabric, you might have to repeat this process a few times to remove all the polish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOpZidsV2ouqK%2B06xkn6ecoby4edOhnKydXajBprzSZqCfZamkwm621KyrZqugnrmtscNmsKitomK7orXLZqeopJmotW6x1Z6psq%2BYmr%2Bme5GqbaxvZ64%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./un-epci-met-en-place-une-couveuse-en-maraichage-biologique-81.html><span>←</span><span>Un EPCI met en place une couveuse en marachage biologique (81)</span></a>
