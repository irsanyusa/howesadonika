While this series is known for limiting air time, season 20 contestant Normandy has shed light on why some singers don’t make it to Hollywood week after their Golden Ticket.</strong></p><p>Since this series has a history of limiting singer airtime, it’s not a surprise when some fan favorites aren’t seen in Hollywood week. Most singers aren’t aired in Hollywood week, but Normandy tells a different story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-normandy-get-a-golden-ticket-but-not-appear-in-hollywood-week>Why Did Normandy Get a Golden Ticket But Not Appear in Hollywood Week?</h2><p>On March 31, Normandy took to TikTok to discuss her lack of appearance on American Idol‘s Hollywood week. She acknowledges that she earned a golden ticket, but not an invitation for Hollywood week. Before shedding any light on the issue, she expressed that she was not bashing the series itself. Instead, she was sharing her point of view for how the process in Hollywood works.</p><p>“We filmed the auditions back in October and Hollywood week was back in December. Late November I got a call from Fremantle, which is the production company, and they told me that I would not be going to Hollywood,” Normandy said. “This is very very common because they get hundreds of people that they give yeses to so not everyone can go to Hollywood week because too many people.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=3><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@normandyofficial/video/7080989390365035822?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7051959652032448005</p></figure><p>Before ending the video Normandy reminded her fans that this is completely normal practice. On top of her personal experience, she included that it’s normal for artists to get further the competition without their audition airing.</p><p>Normandy has constantly replied to comments expressing that she has no hard feelings toward the series. Instead, she understands that it’s just how the business works. This singer had a hefty number of competition show auditions under her belt ahead of American Idol, so she does have an understanding of how the business works.</p><p>Before American Idol, she had auditioned for The Voice, <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a>, and even Alter Ego. Right before this series, she was a paid actor for Alter Ego. The singer claims that she was not apart of the pilot due to creative differences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Would She Audition For Idol Again?</h2><p>Amid the TikTok uproar, Normandy clarified that she couldn’t audition for American Idol again, even if she wanted to. This series has a strict age limit, singers must be between the ages of 15 and 29 years old. Normandy explained that she just turned 29 years old so she cannot audition again.</p><p>Instead, she’s focusing on her social media career. Within the video she explained that she’s currently working on merchandise, a cartoon, and a music video. Normandy’s social media has always featured a ton of music, so I’m sure it’ll remain the same. It doesn’t seem like she’s interested in joining another series at this time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=3><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@normandyofficial/video/7080990628632464682?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7051959652032448005</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1198152930.jpg alt="Robin Thicke Performs Song ‘Day One Friend’ A Cappella on ‘The Nick Cannon Show’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaipppmemcZuvsSvnJqko2LBqbGMq5yapF2nsqK%2FzqdkrKCVYrGqsM2tZKmdopu8s7mMnayroZ6ceqm7y6WwsKefmXq4scSkZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./middle-east-a-hero-returns.html><span>←</span><span>MIDDLE EAST: A Hero Returns</span></a>
