What do you get when you put topless women and an image that looks like the Twin Towers on a Canadian $20 dollar bill? A lot of controversy.
The newly redesigned $20 bill was unveiled by the Bank of Canada in Ottawa last week, according to the Daily Mail. The revamped bill — the most counterfeited Canadian tender in circulation — is manufactured from a high-tech polymer and boasts a difficult-to-copy design that’s supposed to make it much more difficult to produce."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

A lot of controversy.<span id=more-145030></span></p><p>The newly redesigned $20 bill was unveiled by the Bank of Canada in Ottawa last week, according to the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. The revamped bill — the most counterfeited Canadian tender in circulation — is manufactured from a high-tech polymer and boasts a difficult-to-copy design that’s supposed to make it much more difficult to produce.</p><p>If only someone had taken a closer look at what the new design actually was. While it features a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp; (Canada is a commonwealth country, don’t forget), it also carries a reproduction of the <a href=#>National Vimy Memorial</a>. There are a couple problems here: for one thing, the Vimy Memorial, created to honor Canadian servicemembers who lost their lives during World War I, is not the most recognizable of&nbsp; national symbols. “I’ve never seen this monument, ever,” said one Vancouver participant in a <a href=#>Bank of Canada focus group</a> on the bill.</p><p>For another, it also happens to be in France: the memorial rises 120 feet over the Douai Plain, near the battlefields where more than 7,000 Canadian soldiers lost their lives.</p><p>But the biggest problem may be that the Vimy’s double-columned design, draped with semi-clad classical figures, manages to evoke both the ill-fated Twin Towers of New York City and softcore porn. “When you quickly glance at it, and if I didn’t know any better, it looks like the Twin Towers,” one focus group participant said, according to documents from Toronto market research firm The Strategic Council obtained by <a href=#>Canadian broadcaster CTV News</a>. Critics called special attention to the figures draped revealingly across the top of the monument, meant to represent Justice and Peace. “It’s too pornographic,” a cash handler in Toronto told researchers. “What is the woman on the top holding?”</p><p>Many people were also critical of the war and military theme of the bill.</p><p>“Given the climate domestically and around the world, I wonder if war is too much of a statement. . . . Canada used to have the label of peacekeeper,” &nbsp;a focus group participant from Halifax said to CTV.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Canada’s currency has evoked controversy. Similar focus groups were conducted for the&nbsp;polymer versions of the redesigned $100 and $50 bills that are already in use. Many people in the focus group mistook the DNA strand featured on the $100 bill for a sex toy. Others thought the see-through windows on the bills resembled the contours of a woman’s body. Who knew money notes could be so risque?</p><p>The $20 notes will go into circulation in November. New $5 and $10 bills will be issued by the end of 2013, according to the Bank of Canada.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kill the Dollar Coin — Long Live the Dollar Coin!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH12e5BqZp2hoqnGbrnOp5yyZZmoeqStzZqbmqtdo7K4eZFpZJuhnKF6sbvRp6agqpGltaqvjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chemist-omar-yaghi-is-on-a-quest-to-eliminate-water-scarcity.html><span>←</span><span>This Chemist Wants to Suck Water, and Carbon, Out of the Air</span></a>
