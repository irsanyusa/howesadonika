<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>8 Rules That Mayim Bialik Has for Her Children That Could Reshape Parenting</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Mayim Bialik is&nbsp;renowned for her portrayal of&nbsp;the brilliant character on&nbsp;<i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, but she is&nbsp;a&nbsp;versatile woman with various skills. Along with being an&nbsp;actress and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>neuroscientist</a>, her most commendable role is&nbsp;that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;two children. Bialik’s perspective on&nbsp;parenting is&nbsp;contemporary and distinctive, and her concepts are certainly worth considering.</p><p><h2>1. Her children are homeschooled.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b44/987/28fa4058eab4baf2bf3d62da4e.jpg><p>Mayim Bialik doesn’t agree with the standard schooling environment, which is&nbsp;why she’s decided to&nbsp;take things into her own hands and homeschool her children. She claims that this allows her boys to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>develop</a> at&nbsp;their own pace and helps them pursue what they’re passionate about, all while focusing on&nbsp;imagination and play.</p><p><h2>2. Her kids were breastfed until late.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/01e/6fd/b83294532d8cc7cddc6608b866.png><p>Mayim Bialik also embraced the idea of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breastfeeding</a> her children as&nbsp;toddlers. While most mothers try to&nbsp;nurse their children for as&nbsp;little time as&nbsp;possible, Bialik let her boys decide when they wanted to&nbsp;wean. Due to&nbsp;<a href=# title=breastfeeding data-link=tag>breastfeeding</a>’s benefits, her kids grew up&nbsp;throwing fewer tantrums and feeling closer to&nbsp;their mother.</p><p><h2>3. She potty trained her kids without using diapers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6d6/bb1/fe46c250aeb1473e1e25f57c11.png><p>Nobody likes changing diapers, but likely, the majority of&nbsp;parents wouldn’t choose to&nbsp;have their children go&nbsp;diaperless. However, Mayim Bialik doesn’t have dirty diaper problems, as&nbsp;she’s chosen to&nbsp;not use any. Instead, she decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for diaperless potty training, which circles around the idea that every baby <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>signals</a> whenever they have to&nbsp;go. She claims that once you figure out what the signals are, all you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;position your baby over the potty and make a&nbsp;cue (for example, a&nbsp;sound) that they will respond&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>4. She doesn’t buy expensive Christmas presents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/9d7/c386a95e7da3190b2d996f06dd.jpg><p>Each year, her boys get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>presents</a> during the holiday season. While she is&nbsp;fine with them receiving gifts from their grandparents, she has chosen not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. Instead, Bialik and her ex-husband decide on&nbsp;one toy or&nbsp;gift them socks and pajamas if&nbsp;they need them. The reason behind this is&nbsp;that her kids have everything they need, while there are “so&nbsp;many lacking so&nbsp;much,” and she would rather donate to&nbsp;causes that help people in&nbsp;need than spend money on&nbsp;expensive gifts.</p><p><h2>5. She is&nbsp;all about positive discipline.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d6f/4fc/831f0e512da4efbf11e7eba847.png><p>Mayim Bialik is&nbsp;all about positive discipline and integrating a&nbsp;healthy communication style between her and her children. This means that when problems arise, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;yelling, no&nbsp;spanking, time-outs, or&nbsp;scolding. Instead, she tries to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explain</a> everything to&nbsp;her boys in&nbsp;a&nbsp;calm manner, using rational arguments that they can understand.</p><p>Her basic rule is&nbsp;that you should treat your children the way you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated because a&nbsp;healthy relationship is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;respect. Therefore, this method doesn’t make your children fear you, and it&nbsp;helps them develop self-discipline.</p><p><h2>6. She encourages bed-sharing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d7/54b/28c04c5bd1ae1caec57ff9bff1.jpg><p>Bed-sharing is&nbsp;another important aspect of&nbsp;attachment parenting, as&nbsp;it’s the nighttime version of&nbsp;baby-wearing. Since attachment parenting is&nbsp;all about being as&nbsp;close to&nbsp;your child as&nbsp;possible, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;obvious why Mayim Bialik chose to&nbsp;share the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bed</a> with her boys. She claims that bed-sharing helps strengthen their relationship, prevents separation anxiety, and helps the child sleep longer and better.</p><p><h2>7. Her kids have restricted access to&nbsp;technology.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/215/16f/857dd95b17924815e6aab3fb57.jpg><p>Although Mayim Bialik is&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV star, her children don’t really see her on&nbsp;TV because there are certain technology <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rules</a> in&nbsp;the house. Her kids are not allowed to&nbsp;watch movies or&nbsp;TV because she doesn’t want their personalities and self-esteem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;influenced by&nbsp;the media or&nbsp;be&nbsp;peer pressured by&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;fact, the first video Mayim’s son watched was of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homebirth</a>, preparing him for his brother’s arrival. He&nbsp;even was present during his brother’s birth, cutting the cord.</p><p><h2>8. Saying “please” and “thank you” are not encouraged.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/871/60d/5bacb35bc08be0bc9b3e0c1403.jpg><p>While most children are taught from a&nbsp;very early age to&nbsp;say “please” and “thank you,” Bialik decided to&nbsp;teach them the opposite, guiding her children not to&nbsp;use those words at&nbsp;all. She also had a&nbsp;talk with all her friends and family, informing them not to&nbsp;expect those kinds of&nbsp;reactions from her boys. She believes that natural, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>genuine</a> expressions of&nbsp;appreciation are more important than repeating those words out of&nbsp;courtesy because, in&nbsp;time, they start losing their true meaning.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this way of&nbsp;parenting?
