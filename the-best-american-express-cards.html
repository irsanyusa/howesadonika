That makes the welcome bonus worth $700.

You can also get 2x points on reservations made through Amex Travel.</p><p>Best of all, if you make 30 or more purchases in a billing period, you'll earn a 50% bonus. That means that those little $3 and $4 charges for things like coffee or a snack can help you get a ton of points quickly.</p><p>The card also offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 12 months, before switching to a variable 15.2426.24% APR.
