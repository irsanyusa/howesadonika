Their story became a&nbsp;lesson to&nbsp;all naysayers who skeptically treat any relationship that’s born online and developed over the big distance. The duo have built a&nbsp;happy blended <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and made it&nbsp;official after Tony adopted all six of&nbsp;his wife’s kids from her previous marriage.</p><p>Tony Thomas and Lexy first met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating site. This happened just a&nbsp;month after Lexy, the stay-at-home mom, first signed&nbsp;up. She lived in&nbsp;Kentucky at&nbsp;the time, and her family was already very big at&nbsp;that moment. Lexy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom for sons Elijah, 16, Isaiah, 15, Ethan, 14, Sheldon, 12, Simeon, 10, and Iridius who is&nbsp;7.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was true love at&nbsp;first sight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb5/fab/16b4625dfcae10e58fe9476d1d.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/354/47f/6f09265dcbba6d3a41ca969f94.jpg><p>The couple started talking <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>online</a>, and their relationship soon started to&nbsp;grow into something big. In&nbsp;fact, Tony and Lexy began dating long distance, and such a&nbsp;relationship model lasted for some time. Then, there was a&nbsp;big day, when Tony finally decided to&nbsp;fly to&nbsp;see Lexy and her big brood in&nbsp;Kentucky.</p><p>Tony and Lexy both instantly fell madly in&nbsp;love. Many people were sure that their relationship wouldn’t work out. Lexy revealed, that the odds really weren’t in&nbsp;their favor.</p><p><h2>Lexy still considers their love a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;miracle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/864/1ce/7a9000598e93e73f65a3923550.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7b/b58/14ab1b567bb5b9a542c0fe6978.jpg><p>Lexy took to&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> with a&nbsp;candid video, where she shared her thoughts on&nbsp;their romance and relationship. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clip</a> is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;the snaps where the happy couple are posing together, and Lexy made some captions explaining why actually many people were so&nbsp;skeptical about their love, and why she actually thinks it’s a&nbsp;real miracle.</p><p>She pointed out that the odds of&nbsp;them getting together were really tiny. Lexy, a&nbsp;mom of&nbsp;6&nbsp;young kids, living in&nbsp;Kentucky, and Tony, a&nbsp;dad to&nbsp;an&nbsp;almost grown daughter, living 863 miles away in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a>. Lexy confessed that no&nbsp;one really believed it&nbsp;would work out, but it&nbsp;did, and then the woman goes on&nbsp;with absolutely happy moments of&nbsp;their life together, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> in&nbsp;the comments, that for them both, it’s been quite the journey, but one she would do&nbsp;again in&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartbeat with Tony as&nbsp;her husband in&nbsp;the end.</p><p><h2>The adoption process took their relationship to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new level.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e51/27e/910dfe5e79b1fc30c7e7e740c0.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a0/682/602d055571a02d51e3b532c1da.jpg><p>Not only Lexy had kids from her previous marriage. Tony also had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>21</a>-year-old daughter from his ended relationship, and the man made a&nbsp;crucial decision to&nbsp;adopt Lexy’s 6&nbsp;boys. The adoption paperwork took four years after their wedding, and finally he&nbsp;became the boys’ dad officially.</p><p>Their biological <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>father</a> was no&nbsp;longer in&nbsp;their life and the kids hadn’t seen him since they were younger, so&nbsp;there were no&nbsp;obstacles for Tony to&nbsp;officially adopt all kids, except for their own will. Lexy shared that her children love Tony so&nbsp;much they didn’t hesitate even for a&nbsp;moment to&nbsp;take his surname.</p><p>Now, Tony is&nbsp;on&nbsp;all the kids’ birth certificates as&nbsp;their father. One of&nbsp;the kids even insisted on&nbsp;changing his first, middle and last name when he&nbsp;was finally adopted by&nbsp;Tony. The happy couple started planning for the whole big family to&nbsp;live together in&nbsp;Florida after they got married.</p><p><h2>The happy brood continues to&nbsp;grow, with some new family members on&nbsp;their way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/edb/540/8a3d87582a96beb2d52dff5dc5.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5b/e6a/dcc138581d91921591b6e2f35f.jpg><p>The couple have since <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcomed</a> another daughter together, and their latest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>baby</a> #9. They often post videos online about coping with their blended family. Lexy jokingly calls her beloved a&nbsp;super weird husband, but she admits that in&nbsp;the person of&nbsp;Tony she has got all characteristics she would attribute to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ideal man for her.</p><p>Both spouses love their messy household, and the chaotic lifestyle they’ve got with so&nbsp;many kids around. They call themselves a&nbsp;very blended family because there has never been such a&nbsp;huge combination of&nbsp;the dynamic of&nbsp;Tony’s kids and Lexie’s kids. But, without any doubt, they all are a&nbsp;family, and there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;separation.</p><p>And here’s yet another touching adoption story about a&nbsp;single gay man, who <a href=#>adopted</a> a&nbsp;girl with Down syndrome, after she was rejected by&nbsp;many families.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uucCnZLCgn2KzprjLZqCnZZykw6Z51qKroWWRYsCqusalnGaln6J6sLKMb2Sopl2WeqWt06KloGWRpb1uv8SlnaWdo6i5unnAnaaprKNirq24jKidZqCVp3qstcOsZHFpZWyDd3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-dexter-original-sin-importance-1236088519.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
