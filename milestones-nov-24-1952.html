Author Brown did much of her work in a deserted old house on the Maine coast liked the challenge of writing for five-year-olds because she thought they were at the height of their sensory awareness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died.

So violent were his pre-World War II attacks against his enemies-of-the-moment that he was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, served time in jail for “incitement to murder” and was deluged with libel suits. Convicted in 1945 of collaborating with the Nazis, he had served seven years of a life imprisonment sentence when he was released because of age and ailments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tanFnaIBwucilnKysn6OytHnNqK1mamRifnqBkWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./events.html><span>←</span><span>Historical Events in May 2017</span></a>
