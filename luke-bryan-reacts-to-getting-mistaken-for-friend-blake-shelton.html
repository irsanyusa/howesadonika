Still, that doesn’t stop some people from confusing them. Bryan responded to a case of mistaken identity on The Tonight Show this week.</strong></p><p>Host Jimmy Fallon brought up a past Instagram post by Bryan, in which he lamented that a television show had incorrectly identified him as his friend, Shelton. Bryan shared his thoughts on the comparison.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-o8xFalOie/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-bryan-reacts-to-being-mistaken-for-blake-shelton>Luke Bryan Reacts to Being Mistaken for Blake Shelton</h2><p>Last year, Bryan posted a shot of himself performing on television. The chyron underneath him incorrectly identified him as fellow country star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Shelton</a>. Bryan captioned the Instagram post at the time, “I gotta work harder.”</p><p>Fallon showed a printed copy of the post for his interview with Bryan, who jokingly took credit for Shelton’s former Sexiest Man Alive title. Shelton won the honor from People magazine in 2017, and <a href=#>later passed the baton</a> to his Voice co-star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Legend</a>.</p><p>“Before I even posted it on Instagram, I sent it to Blake,” Bryan recalled of the mix-up. “And I’m like, ‘I mean, my life is pretty much over after this point.'”</p><p>He went on to compare his look to Shelton’s, pointing out that Shelton “chooses to go gray” and looks like a “silver fox.” Bryan, who is the same age as Shelton, uses Just For Men to cover that up. And yet, as he joked, “I still can’t separate from Blake.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>BLAKE SHELTON’S BIGGEST BROMANCES RANKED THROUGH THE YEARS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryan-talks-about-missing-american-idol-due-to-covid-19>Bryan Talks About Missing ‘American Idol’ Due to COVID-19</h3><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>WYATT PIKE DID NOT FIGHT LUKE BRYAN DESPITE CONSPIRACY THEORIES</a></strong></p><p>Bryan is currently judging <a href=#>Season 19</a> of American Idol. Unfortunately, he had to miss the first live show of the season, as he tested positive for COVID-19. Former judge<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Paula Abdul</a> filled in for him on the judging panel. Bryan talked to Fallon about the experience.</p><p>“I was doing as good as I could,” Bryan said. “I really had done a great job at the mask and all that. And then to have that happen, it was a bummer. And I was like, ‘Oh gosh, this is gonna be a media nightmare, and I’m gonna have to miss stuff.'”</p><p>Bryan said he quarantined in his house, adding that it was “pretty easy to get through.” He shared that he was glad to be back on the show for the rest of the season, praising the level of talent that the competition has seen this year.</p><p>American Idol Season 19 returns for<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Disney Night </a>this Sunday, May 2, on ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ken-Jeong-The-Masked-Singer-Getty-scaled-e1643652530741.jpg alt="‘Masked Singer’ Judge Ken Jeong to Host AAPI Heritage Month Event" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y66inmWSp8aiuoyrnJqbpKh6tbuMoJytrJmjtG65yKyrmqOVo3qnu9FmnauhlaOxbq7LmqKeZaOdsq3Azqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neutralite-carbone-les-quatre-scenarios-de-transitions-de-lademe-pour-2050.html><span>←</span><span>les quatre scnarios de &amp;quot;transition(s)&amp;quot; de l'Ademe pour 2050</span></a>
