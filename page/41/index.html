Built in 2001, this rather luxurious toilet is made of solid 24-carat gold and coated with gems. Everything in the restroom surrounding it  sink, tiles and doors  is also made of solid gold; the display at Hang Fung Gold Technology's showroom in Hong Kong is today worth more than $29 million. The bathroom was the brainchild of jeweler Lam Sai-wing, who was inspired by communist leader Lenin's vision that the most appropriate thing to do with gold would be to build public toilets out of it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>20 Makeovers That Helped Women Proudly Demonstrate Their Gray Hair</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>

Until recently, gray hair was stigmatized, and women spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;effort, money, and time trying to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it. But nowadays, silver strands are on-trend and can add a&nbsp;special charm to&nbsp;your look. Hairstylist Jack Martin from California helps his clients enhance the natural beauty of&nbsp;their hair, so&nbsp;they are unlikely to&nbsp;ever be&nbsp;ashamed of&nbsp;their gray hair again.

During a shutdown, the government can only spend money on essential services, such as those related to law enforcement and public safety. That means hundreds of thousands of federal workers won’t receive a timely paycheck, while others will be furloughed, which could inflict severe financial hardships on some American families at a time when many are still struggling with elevated prices due to inflation and impending student loan repayments.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jane Seymour, 72, Shines in Her Natural Body, Embracing Her Curves and Defying Age Expectations</h2><time>Jul 27, 2024</time>
