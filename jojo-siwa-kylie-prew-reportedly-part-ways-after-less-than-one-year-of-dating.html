JoJo publicly admitted that she’s going through something extreme that she has never gone through before. Fans quickly caught on that the <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a> celebrity was referencing a break up from her first public girlfriend.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reportedly</a>, this celebrity couple broke up two weeks ago, and much of the DWTS cast is aware of the split. Fans caught on to the split once Kylie was no longer apart of the show’s audience. Fans noticed that Kylie flew back to her home state of Florida after staying with JoJo in California for several months.</p><p>The couple had been dating since January 2021, but made their relationship public in February. They were friends for over a year before beginning their relationship.</p><p>At this same time, JoJo announced that she was a part of the LGBTQ+ community while a guest on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, she revealed that it was her girlfriend that encouraged her to publicly come out. Throughout their relationship, both the Dancing with the Stars celebrity and her girlfriend posted monthly pictures to celebrate their milestones.</p><p>Many fans caught on to their spit when both JoJo and Kylie ignored their monthly tradition for what would’ve been their nine month celebration.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo Siwa is Taking the Time to Process her Break up</h2><p>When asked about the break up in an interview after <a href=#>Grease Night</a>, JoJo did not confirm nor deny the split. Instead she spoke on how grateful she is for Dancing with the Stars as an outlet during this hard time.</p><p>“I think that eventually through dance I want to share my story and we’ll get there,” <a href=#>said</a> Siwa. “I’m taking time, I’m letting my brain–hasn’t even processed everything yet and that’s something that I say everyday. I’m like my brain hasn’t had time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPtYOAsHnjd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>As of right now, JoJo is primarily focused on the dance competition. Even though she’s going through personal issues, it’s been reported that she doesn’t want to let her fans down. Since the breakup, fans have noticed the friendship bloom between JoJo and her professional dance partner, Jenna Johnson. Some fans claim their friendship had something to with the break up, but a source confirmed that Jenna is a <a href=#>big sister figure</a> to JoJo. It was also stated that their friendship did not trigger the break up.</p><p>As a big sister figure to JoJo, Jenna has been helping the teen stay grounded amid her grief. JoJo has <a href=#>shared</a> that her partner periodically checks up on her mental health during rehearsals and has been extremely supportive. On top of supporting JoJo through her breakup, Jenna has also helped JoJo gain confidence in herself and <a href=#>her body image</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1331011509.jpg alt="Blake Shelton Goes Platinum with ‘If I’m Honest,’ Lands CMA Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo Siwa</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecqyo6KdXaW%2FpsOMq5ypp6KpsqW42GanmqqkYsSixdJmmJ%2Bslad6rbHSrGStoJGjerC6xGawnpmiYrynecOaq6Kml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-robin-wright-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Robin Wright Make?
