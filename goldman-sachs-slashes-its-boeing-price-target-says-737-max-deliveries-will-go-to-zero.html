The stock was down 1.2% at $370 a share early Tuesday.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Despite the fallout surrounding the crashes, Poponak has found most discussions with investors expressing "minimum overall concern with BA [Boeing] medium and long-term earnings and free cash estimates." The investors cite assumptions of a relatively quick software fix and the long-cycle delay involved in switching to competitor Airbus according to the research note.</p><p>While Poponak recognizes these factors, he also raises three major risks to this outlook.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>1. "Potential revisions to the airplane"</h3></p><p>There is material risk that the safety of the 737 Max cannot be assured through a simple software fix, Poponak said. The Max was re-fitted with a new engine as well as other structural changes from its proven predecessor, the 737 Classic. He added, the Max will also face intense regulatory scrutiny globally which could raise further issues.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>2. "Competitive alternatives"</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Airbus does have some capacity to raise production if there is demand. In addition, leasing companies can also offer alternatives if airlines are willing to rent, Poponak said. Customers may reduce schedules over the short-term and push back delivery plans, opening the door for a re-energized Airbus in the narrow-body market.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>3. "Longer lasting demand impacts"</h3></p><p><a href=# id=d1659cff-1272-3fec-ade2-56a571a3133a>Customers are asking more questions of airlines with respect to the 737 Max</a> than they have of prior groundings, such as the Boeing 787 battery-fix, Poponak wrote. In addition, governments in countries outside the US, which have far less political ties to the manufacturer, are raising a variety of concerns. Poponak sees a risk that these factors play out over the long-term, reducing the ultimate demand and profitability of the 737 Max.</p><p>Boeing was up 15% this year through Monday.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="BA stock chart"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/8DsktktTURBXy9kYWMxZDE0My1mZGI3LTRmNDAtODJiOC0yODNjMDA5Nzg1NTMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQKOwsM></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyou8udpJqmXaiupLTSZqqlmaOdsrR5yK2qZpqfmravs4ypqaKblWLBor7Gnqtmq5GuwG6DknBkppmoYrGmuMivnKuhlah6uLXLpWSgp12pvG7GxKumaKumabSstpg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eugene-dan-levy-emmys-host-sept-15-1236108670.html><span>←</span><span>Eugene and Dan Levy Officially Set as Emmys Hosts</span></a>
