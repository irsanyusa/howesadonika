She candidly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “I&nbsp;realized that when you pass, the only thing you take with you is&nbsp;the love you’ve shared and the difference you’ve made.”</p><p>This profound revelation led her to&nbsp;the understanding that “It’s all connected. There’s not one thing that I&nbsp;do that’s not connected to&nbsp;mind, body, and soul.” Since then, she has prioritized personal growth and fostering positivity, firmly believing that by&nbsp;nurturing her soul, its radiance will manifest in&nbsp;her physical being.</p><p><h2>Her mother represented her main source of&nbsp;inspiration.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9a/560/ec4a25574caaf5960e0ad814c4.jpg><p>Jane shared that she also learned the importance of&nbsp;connecting to&nbsp;her inner self through her mother.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that her mom couldn’t splurge on&nbsp;skincare, so&nbsp;she instead focused on&nbsp;self-care: <strong>“She never had any money and couldn’t afford any kind of&nbsp;facials.</strong> She took care of&nbsp;herself... and her whole philosophy in&nbsp;life was that everyone had a&nbsp;challenge, and when they did, they had to&nbsp;accept&nbsp;it, open up&nbsp;their hearts, and reach out to&nbsp;help other people. And in&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, [they] would help themselves.”</p><p><h2>She avoids fad diets.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66f/0dc/614ab259c39c47d9f26d001e4b.jpg><p>You might think Jane is&nbsp;very strict with her food, but it’s actually the opposite. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that she loves food and doesn’t keep track of&nbsp;her weight, but she does prioritize good nutrition: “Diets for&nbsp;me, never really worked because I’m a&nbsp;foodie. I&nbsp;grow my&nbsp;own vegetables and fruits, and&nbsp;I love flavor. So&nbsp;the whole idea of&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;a&nbsp;number on&nbsp;a&nbsp;scale ... I’m not, you know, crazy about&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e8/400/143ac85e11a573fba691d04d1c.jpg><p><h2>She keeps her body fit.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb9/eec/9eb096529b8aa9d3acd338b61a.jpg><p>Having a&nbsp;deep understanding of&nbsp;the significance of&nbsp;physical well-being, the renowned actress naturally prioritizes fitness while considering the needs of&nbsp;her age and body. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leans</a> towards Pilates and incorporates “lightweights” into her regimen, accompanied by&nbsp;“careful sit-ups” and selected yoga poses. Jane conscientiously listens to&nbsp;her body, acknowledging that “as&nbsp;you get older, you know, your body can’t function the way you’d like it&nbsp;to&nbsp;function.”<br></p><p><h2>She’s protecting her skin at&nbsp;all costs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/beb/483/c2d4375a30977a24cbd025a532.jpg><p>Seymour’s favorite skincare secret is&nbsp;sun protection. She once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>: <strong>“I&nbsp;think having good skin is&nbsp;really the secret to&nbsp;not aging your face.</strong> Using retinol at&nbsp;night, protecting yourself from the sun, using great skincare that plumps your skin ... and pretty much anything that makes me&nbsp;feel healthy is&nbsp;the best anti-aging secret I&nbsp;know.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce2/3bb/743c7d58a888984f21c6331fce.jpg><p>Jane also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed </a>a&nbsp;desire that she had been more cautious about sun exposure during her earlier years. Reflecting on&nbsp;her past, she remarked, “I&nbsp;don’t have many regrets, but I&nbsp;do wish&nbsp;I could advise my&nbsp;younger self against sunbathing with a&nbsp;reflector board and cooking oil during those two weeks of&nbsp;vacation!” However, she reassured that she had long abandoned sun-worshipping, considering herself fortunate.</p><p><h2>She’s all about aging naturally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aca/370/7752d9593cb616bb64b65e8dd8.jpg><p>And, lastly, Seymour <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answered</a> the most burning question: Has she had any work done on&nbsp;her face? The answer is&nbsp;no, but she’s keeping her options open: “As&nbsp;of&nbsp;now,<strong> I&nbsp;have chosen not to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;facelift—but I&nbsp;have nothing against any of&nbsp;it</strong>, nothing... if&nbsp;I felt that somebody could do&nbsp;something that wouldn’t change my&nbsp;face, and&nbsp;I would have the results where&nbsp;I would look just like&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;would do&nbsp;it. I’m not saying I’d never do&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I haven’t done it&nbsp;yet.”</p><p>Jane appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;effortlessly flourishing, captivating her fans, who are in&nbsp;awe of&nbsp;her ageless beauty. Yet, beyond her outward appearance lies a&nbsp;remarkable woman who displayed resilience in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;adversity, building herself up&nbsp;when no&nbsp;one <a href=#>believed</a> in&nbsp;her talent and success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLeiusRmqp6xnaTCs3mWa2SsoJmjsrR5yKdkoZ2iYruiwNSrmKVlkqSxunnEppmrmZOeu6h5x56pZpulp8Omv4yapZ1llJqzurXNoGSan5Visrm8xJyrmqyZpLu0eZdqamxoYmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-government-shutdown-affects-americans.html><span>←</span><span>How a Government Shutdown Could Affect You</span></a>
