Here's what we found:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hotels are the first tab on Costco Travel's site. To search for a hotel, you'll have to enter the destination and the dates of check-in and check-out.</p><p>This is what the results look like after searching. Prices are concealed until you enter your Costco membership number.</p><p>Results can be filtered further by the hotel's ratings ...</p><p>... or by hotel chain names.</p><p>To see if Costco's deals are as good as it claims, we compared a few of the luxury hotels' prices to prices on other travel sites like Expedia, Priceline, and the hotels' websites themselves. The first place we checked was New York. Booking a night at The London through Costco in June would cost about $526 before taxes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This was about $50 cheaper than it would be to book the same night through the Conrad Hotels & Resorts website. The London NYC was not available on Priceline or Expedia.</p><p>A night at the Conrad hotel in Chicago was $403 before fees through Costco ...</p><p>... and $408 through Expedia. Through the Conrad Chicago website, the same room was $425 for the night, before tax. In this case, Costco offered a discount of about 4% from the hotel website.</p><p>The trend continued across the US. The Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, booked through Costco, was $722 for one night, before tax.</p><p>It was $760 per night, before tax, when booked through the hotel's website. In this case, Costco offered a 5% savings from the Waldorf Astoria website. The Priceline and Expedia prices both fell in between the two, at around $730 for the night.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Even booking international hotels through Costco proved to be cost-effective. The Savoy, a Fairmont-managed luxury hotel in London, cost about $766 for the night when booked through Costco.</p><p>That same hotel, booked through the hotel's website, was $869 for the night, about $100 more than through Costco. Costco offered a 12% savings for this hotel. However, the Priceline and Expedia prices for one night at this hotel were only $2 more than at Costco.</p><p>A night at the Waldorf Astoria-owned Trianon Palace Versailles in France is about $271 through Costco ...</p><p>... and about $342 through the Waldorf Astoria website. The Costco price is significantly lower again, offering almost a 20% discount from the hotel's website. However, the same hotel is on Priceline for $249, lower than Costco and the Waldorf Astoria website.</p><p>A downside to Costco Travel is that prices are listed in the local currency of where you're traveling to, making it a little more difficult to compare. That being said, a week at the Hilton Tokyo is about $311 ...</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>... which is $20 cheaper than the Hilton Tokyo website listing's for the same room. Priceline actually had the cheapest price for this hotel, at $304 for the night. Costco Travel can definitely offer some serious savings to members, but the deals are no more consistent than competitors'.</p><p>You'll have to be a Costco member to take advantage of these deals, however.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70q2pmqyVnMZwv9OrmK2dl656pLvSrZqoZaeeua15zaiuZqSVqXq6u9Rmmainm2K5tsTUq7BmoJ%2Bpsq2%2FjJ%2Bmq2WUnsCku9Snq6xln5t6tryMraZma2Bitaa%2BxKxmp6mXl7ezgg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jehovahs-witnesses-why-religious-group-does-not-celebrate-birthdays.html><span>←</span><span>Why religious group does not celebrate birthdays</span></a>
