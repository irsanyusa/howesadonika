But how do Brits feel about the humble Hawaiian?</h3><p>Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, the president of Iceland (the country, not the supermarket) made international news a couple of weeks ago when it emerged that he wanted to ban pineapple as a topping on pizza.</p><p>The president was later forced to clarify that a pineapple topping ban was merely a personal desire, not a policy objective, and that he did not have the power to create such a law in any case.</p><p>Whilst the Icelandic president may not have the power, one group of people certainly do: staff at pizza restaurants. An American pizza delivery recently went <a href=#>viral on Twitter</a> after the customer discovered that staff had outright refused to top their pizza with pineapple, with a message scrawled on the inside of the box branding it “gross”.</p><p>Whether pineapple belongs on pizza has always been a divisive issue. Following the president’s remarks, YouGov finds that whilst 84% of Brits say they like pizza, and a similar 82% like pineapple, only 53% say that they like pineapple on pizza. In good news for the Hawaiian haters, more than four in ten Brits (41%) dislike pineapple on pizza.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Pineapple20on20pizza-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Should they ever become more powerful than the President of Iceland and gain the power to prohibit toppings, 15% of Brits who like pizza would ban pineapple. This figure rises to almost half (49%) among those who dislike pineapple on pizza a lot.</p><p>However, of the toppings that the public want banned, pineapple only comes fifth. Top of the list is anchovies, which more than a third of people (35%) would ban if they could – far more than any other topping. Olives came in second at 20%, followed closely by tuna at 19%.</p><h4><strong>Pizza preferences</strong></h4><p>In terms of what people actually like to have on a pizza, YouGov can now reveal that the nation’s most popular topping is mushroom, which are enjoyed by nearly two thirds of Brits (65%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Pizza-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Overall, seven pizza toppings are enjoyed by more than half of the country: joining mushrooms are onion (62%), ham (61%), peppers (60%), chicken (56%), pepperoni (56%) and tomato (as a topping, 51%). Meanwhile the two fish options, tuna (22%) and anchovy (18%), are the least popular on the list.</p><p>Men are much more likely than women to like meat on their pizza – a trend we also found in our previous survey on <a href=#>Full English breakfasts</a>. They are also much more likely to enjoy chillies and jalapenos, whilst women are noticeably more likely to enjoy spinach.</p><p>There are also some notable trends between different age groups. For instance, the older people get the more likely they are to like having mushroom or tomato as a topping, and become less likely to want chicken, pepperoni, sweetcorn and pork on their pizza.</p><p>Photo: iStockphoto</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYWyEcoCMnaaeq12ltq%2BxwKmnpZ1dl7Ktu82gZKmhqq%2Bu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toys-for-adults-popularity.html><span>←</span><span>Adults Are Buying Toys and Stuffed Animals for Themselves</span></a>
