In&nbsp;fact, there are even <a href=#>threads</a> with tons of&nbsp;messages on&nbsp;social media where people share their experience of&nbsp;meeting a&nbsp;completely different person from what their profile suggested. This often has nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with photoshop or&nbsp;<a href=#>catfishing</a>, but other factors that affect the way we&nbsp;think we&nbsp;look and how others see&nbsp;us.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> found out the facts about why our looks appear differently to&nbsp;others and now you can learn about it&nbsp;too.</p><p><h2>1. Mirrors won’t give your true reflection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/168/ed0/3f4e515a398c344c3482b1a05e.jpg><p>When you look in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mirror, who do&nbsp;you see? Not the person other people see, since our reflection in&nbsp;the mirror is&nbsp;<a href=#>reversed</a> by&nbsp;our brain. Raise your left hand, and the person in&nbsp;the mirror raises their right hand. From the way we&nbsp;part our hair to&nbsp;the way we&nbsp;smile, our faces are not symmetrical. The image we&nbsp;see looking at&nbsp;us from the mirror is&nbsp;not the face we&nbsp;show to&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— left and right are reversed.</p><p><h2>2. Photo filters and angles can present your looks differently.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c52/6ed/9251975e728d6afd49f6b07915.jpg><p>Experienced photographers <a href=#>say</a> that the <strong><a href=# title=camera data-link=tag>camera</a> often distorts our appearance</strong> and can change it&nbsp;either for better or&nbsp;for worse (like while doing selfies). Surprisingly, our brain works like Photoshop. Our eyes (with help from our brain) automatically adjust to&nbsp;darkness and brightness.</p><p>Our cameras are not as&nbsp;amazing because they can be&nbsp;adjusted to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;highlights or&nbsp;shadows, but never both at&nbsp;once. This is&nbsp;why <strong>a&nbsp;camera will never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;“see” your true appearance</strong> and reflect it&nbsp;the way the eyes of&nbsp;other people&nbsp;do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad2/ab7/bbf4f658aaaaa6fd9481e7f373.jpg><p>Our eyes <a href=#>“cut”</a> the unnecessary details while looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;person in&nbsp;real life, and this is&nbsp;why <strong>people around&nbsp;us see&nbsp;us in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more detailed way</strong>, while our image in&nbsp;a&nbsp;photo is&nbsp;changed by&nbsp;the details that are in&nbsp;the photo. And because of&nbsp;these details, our pictures may look <a href=#>unflattering</a> even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;are beautiful in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><h2>3. It&nbsp;depends on&nbsp;how other people see themselves too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f68/c78/853f045e5293ff0aa160c12633.jpg><p>A&nbsp;recent <a href=#>study</a> has found out that unattractive people overestimated their attractiveness when compared to&nbsp;strangers. The other side of&nbsp;the coin is&nbsp;that attractive people are usually unaware of&nbsp;their physical charm and underestimate&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another <a href=#>fact</a> is&nbsp;that <strong>attractive people compare themselves to&nbsp;other attractive people</strong>, and unattractive people take their self-esteem from unattractive people. So, our vision of&nbsp;ourselves may be&nbsp;affected by&nbsp;the people around&nbsp;us, because of&nbsp;the way we&nbsp;compare our appearance to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>4. You compare yourself unfairly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9bb/113/544c7f5260b045d5c9a3b1556e.jpg><p>Even though <a href=#>comparing</a> might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural drive, in&nbsp;some cases, it&nbsp;triggers confidence and motivation, in&nbsp;others, it&nbsp;doesn’t help&nbsp;us. Comparing yourself means you are struggling with insecurities which can give you a&nbsp;different picture of&nbsp;your look or&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>5. Fear can cloud your perception.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/b70/470bec584fa94f59381a50118d.jpg><p><strong>Fear can intensify the perception.</strong> <a href=#>Anxiety</a> can target your insecurities and heighten them and it&nbsp;will look like you are searching for threats. For example, if&nbsp;you are afraid that you are starting to&nbsp;show wrinkles even if&nbsp;you are young, you will probably notice them when you look in&nbsp;the mirror.</p><p><h2>6. Changes in&nbsp;your lifestyle can affect the way you see yourself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/303/f74/1cc1d25cde98bbd2f5c5083254.jpg><p><a href=#>Mood</a> swings, lack of&nbsp;sleep, hormone imbalance, poor diet, and other mental and physical changes or&nbsp;conditions might affect your self-perception. Let’s take low-energy for example. When you feel tired you probably don’t smile and this means you lack passion. So, because people are like mirrors and reflect what you project, you won’t be&nbsp;recognized as&nbsp;you see yourself.</p><p><h2>Bonus: You can see your real you with a&nbsp;“true mirror.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c19/e63/3177f35800be85752761326b90.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you’re curious about how you look to&nbsp;other people and want to&nbsp;see yourself as&nbsp;others&nbsp;do, you need a&nbsp;second mirror to&nbsp;undo the effect of&nbsp;the first mirror and switch the directions back again. Surprisingly, this service is&nbsp;offered by&nbsp;some companies, and they suggest you look at&nbsp;yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>True Mirror</a>.</p><p>First patented in&nbsp;<a href=#>1887</a>, the True Mirror uses a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;2&nbsp;mirrors, placed at&nbsp;right angles. It&nbsp;forms a&nbsp;seamless, 3-dimensional, non-reversed image. People who’ve gotten a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;true mirror <a href=#>said</a> that their experience was, “Like I&nbsp;am meeting myself for the first time.” That’s how radical the difference was in&nbsp;their appearance.</p><p>Would you like to&nbsp;see yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;true mirror? How differently do&nbsp;you look in&nbsp;photos?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyypq5lo5qybsXOrqmsnZybeqW1xZ%2Bcq52eqbm6edOhmKdln6m1pr7SZpuoZWhlfXJ9kWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-channels-allowed-to-air-u-k-court-judges-sentencing-remarks-after-bbc-itn-sky-campaign-1235327079.html><span>←</span><span>News Channels Allowed to Air U.K. Court Judges Sentencing Remarks After BBC, ITN, Sky Campa</span></a>
