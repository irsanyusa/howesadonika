And this week, we’re being introduced to the first astrology-based costume we’ve ever seen on the show. The Scorpio looks like they’re bringing big DIVA energy with that bright gold from head to toe.</strong></p><p>So which celebrity could the Scorpio be under the mask? And what are the clues pointing to their identity? Here’s what we know so far about the Scorpio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V52CEH2Ykk</p>Preview of The Masked Singer 80’s Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 9</h2><p>Scorpio’s appearance on the show started with her walking on and all the judges commenting on how small she is! In her clues, she’s standing in front of a red car and mentions that she loves “being over the top.” We see her dancing in front of a “CLAW STREET” sign. Growing up in a small town, she knew she was built for bigger things. The camera pans in to a collection of sports balls while one of the men in black talks on a phone. She hustled, working in fast food and bars to buy her way “out of the sticks and closer to [her] destiny.” We see a crumpled dollar bill fall to the floor.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MACAW? CLUES DECODED + PREDICTION!</a></strong></p><p>Finally, she made her way West and got to “work, clawing [her] way into the industry.” But after years of being other people, the key was just to be herself, even if that makes her the villain sometimes! A computer screen displayed “SCORP10” as a stock symbol. Next, we see a framed photo of a house. The gossip says she’s a “wild thing,” she claims while men in black hold up measuring tape and a manilla folder.</p><p>After her performance, some dancers did the sprinkler as a clue! Scorpio explained, “I’m never the one doing it, but even I know that watering your property is important.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Scorpio</h2><p>Robin predicted this could be a reality star or housewife. Jenny guessed Erika Jayne, Lisa Rinna, or Denise Richards. Ken thought it might be Heidi Klum because of the fashion clues. Nicole noticed her spice and the fact that she could do the splits, so while she didn’t have a guess right away, she didn’t agree with the Heidi Klum guess.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?
