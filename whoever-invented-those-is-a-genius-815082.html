<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Whoever Invented Those Is a Genius</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Have you ever stumbled upon something online that made you say: I&nbsp;wonder how&nbsp;I hadn’t come up&nbsp;with something like that? Well, you’re about to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;many, many times in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row. I&nbsp;mean, isn’t this chair someone found at&nbsp;the food court of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mall the coolest thing ever? You won’t have to&nbsp;put your <a href=# title=bag data-link=tag>bag</a> on&nbsp;the floor or&nbsp;check every two minutes if&nbsp;it&nbsp;hasn’t slipped down from your chair. Little notch, big difference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/186/914/949d7b580195a2dc818667ba14.png><p>Can you guess what these metal things on&nbsp;the corner of&nbsp;the stairs are for? I&nbsp;was confused, too, but it&nbsp;turns out that these are dust corners. And nope, they aren’t there just as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy Victorian-style decor element. They actually keep dust from accumulating in&nbsp;the corners of&nbsp;the stairs to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;easier for you to&nbsp;sweep it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;there.</p><p>Hmmm, this pan seems a&nbsp;bit weird, but in&nbsp;fact, it’s just brilliant. You know when you fry the meat for hamburgers, and then it&nbsp;takes you forever to&nbsp;get the grease off? Well, this shape makes it&nbsp;super easy to&nbsp;drain all that yucky liquid without a&nbsp;problem. No&nbsp;more scraping the pans! If&nbsp;you love French fries, you gotta love this one. Isn’t that mini bowl for sauce on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the packet très magnifique? How many clothing items did you ruin while trying to&nbsp;remove the labels? It&nbsp;won’t happen again if&nbsp;your new garments are going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like this one here. The label is&nbsp;attached to&nbsp;a&nbsp;small piece of&nbsp;fabric and not the item itself. So&nbsp;even if&nbsp;you make a&nbsp;wrong move, your new shirt will be&nbsp;safe. Plus, it&nbsp;won’t leave any tickling traces behind.</p><p>Before you decide this onesie is&nbsp;defective, because you know, these two buttons are different from others in&nbsp;color, here’s some news for you. It’s actually one of&nbsp;those brilliant designs&nbsp;— these buttons are made different so&nbsp;that you can line them up&nbsp;easier. Driving on&nbsp;an&nbsp;icy road can be&nbsp;tricky and dangerous, but knowing what’s ahead of&nbsp;you will help you get alert and pass it&nbsp;easier. This ice alert changes color into blue when it’s freezing outside, so&nbsp;you know what to&nbsp;expect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/42d/311/2164545a7ebecf503b4cebf92f.png><p>Trying to&nbsp;plug in&nbsp;a&nbsp;USB drive, especially when you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush, can be ... well, quite annoying. But this one, with rounded edges&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;whole new level of&nbsp;plugability! And yes, you can now put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;either way, both up&nbsp;and down. This USB-C&nbsp;is becoming the standard one now. If&nbsp;you’ve ever tried to&nbsp;assemble pretty much anything involving bolts, screws, and the like, you know one of&nbsp;those little guys can make a&nbsp;huge difference. Especially when it’s missing. So&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;whoever invented this set design that comes with a&nbsp;separate section with spare parts.</p><p>Another helper for your do-it-yourself, or&nbsp;rather, fix-it-yourself, endeavors. This O-ring bag comes with a&nbsp;scale, and you can double-check if&nbsp;you’re getting the right-sized detail. How much water do&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;boil for just one cup of&nbsp;<a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a>? You don’t have to&nbsp;know as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you have this kettle that knows it&nbsp;for you. <a href=# title=Coffee data-link=tag>Coffee</a>, though, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely different story. Don’t be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;you get one of&nbsp;those fancy Italian coffee makers, and they say it’s for 2&nbsp;cups, and a&nbsp;cup is&nbsp;for like one sip. The real espresso cup should be&nbsp;no&nbsp;bigger than 2-3&nbsp;oz to&nbsp;keep the taste rich, and the temperature&nbsp;— right. Moving on&nbsp;to&nbsp;our next genius design&nbsp;— can you guess what this little hook inside the container is&nbsp;for? It&nbsp;will take care of&nbsp;that scoop that always swims somewhere in&nbsp;your whey, cocoa, flour, or&nbsp;pretty much anything that comes in&nbsp;powder form.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/493/0c0/e537ba5c4688d57b5588fa393a.png><p>Before I&nbsp;explain the next invention: do&nbsp;you know what the dirtiest spot in&nbsp;your bathroom&nbsp;is? Newsflash: it’s not the <a href=# title=toilet data-link=tag>toilet</a>. We&nbsp;believe it’s dirty, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and effort cleaning&nbsp;it. But the real champion when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;germs is&nbsp;the bathroom floor! Your toothbrush holds the second place, followed by&nbsp;the doorknobs, towels, and loofahs. That’s why this elbow-operated bathroom door handle is&nbsp;so&nbsp;brilliant. Your <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> are going to&nbsp;love this one! And it&nbsp;will make taking care of&nbsp;them more fun for you. A&nbsp;watering can and a&nbsp;spray bottle all in&nbsp;one. Super handy! Hmmmm. What kind of&nbsp;contraption is&nbsp;this one? A&nbsp;short online discussion tells&nbsp;us it’s another hybrid, this time for cleaning window tracks. You should use the black part as&nbsp;a&nbsp;scraper to&nbsp;move the dust, then flip the gadget over and use the brush to&nbsp;sweep the dust into the tiny dustpan. I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;it’ll work on&nbsp;my&nbsp;laptop keyboard. Another not-so-obvious design that sparked a&nbsp;whole discussion on&nbsp;the Internet.</p><p>This gadget that punches down has a&nbsp;row of&nbsp;pins and came in&nbsp;a&nbsp;box of&nbsp;craft supplies. Any ideas? If&nbsp;you love putting ribbons on&nbsp;gifts, you need this one in&nbsp;your life! This cool tool is&nbsp;for curling gift ribbons. You gotta pull the ribbon to&nbsp;one side, pinch&nbsp;it, then pull it&nbsp;back with force toward the tail end. And voila, you get a&nbsp;curly bow which takes your gift wrapping to&nbsp;the next level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/260/a55/5015275519927c066ce90c720c.png><p>And about this one? Small silicone tube with two attachments on&nbsp;the sides. Well, do&nbsp;you remember that time when you were learning to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;pencil and write? It&nbsp;would definitely be&nbsp;way easier with this gadget! It’s a&nbsp;silicone holder that can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;hold pens, pencils, scissors, make-up brushes, and maybe other similar things&nbsp;— feel free to&nbsp;get creative.</p><p>One Internet user found it&nbsp;in&nbsp;their hotel room. Must have kept them baffled for a&nbsp;while. But luckily, others knew exactly what this strange phone cord with plastic parts on&nbsp;both ends was for. It’s a&nbsp;two-sided retention cable for a&nbsp;TV remote. You can use it&nbsp;at&nbsp;home if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;lose your remote anymore. But if&nbsp;you find it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the hotel&nbsp;— looks like they don’t trust their guests that much and don’t want you to&nbsp;keep the remote as&nbsp;a&nbsp;souvenir. Forget everything&nbsp;I said before&nbsp;— this machine of&nbsp;the future is&nbsp;my&nbsp;absolute favorite. Because it&nbsp;can ... ta-da ... fold laundry for you! Yep, your shirts can look as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;they did when you bought them. Can you imagine a&nbsp;cuter holder for wireless headphones? Neither can I.&nbsp;Anyone still using ink to&nbsp;write long, romantic letters? Remember to&nbsp;tilt this bottle when it’s three-quarters empty, and don’t lose a&nbsp;drop of&nbsp;ink. This color-coding system for boxes must speed up&nbsp;sorting and delivery a&nbsp;lot! All you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;memorize which color stands for what. Looks like someone is&nbsp;getting pork and vegetable dumplings out of&nbsp;this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a2e/cad/7ba65258ad8efdbefc77586ca6.png><p>Washington D.C. Metro took this idea to&nbsp;the next level and tested the color-coding system on&nbsp;their handrails. They replaced the traditional black ones at&nbsp;one station over the weekend. Red was for Red line, and yellow and green&nbsp;— you guessed it&nbsp;right&nbsp;— for Yellow and Green line trains. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;help passengers find which escalator they needed to&nbsp;reach the right platforms faster. Hiking fans, this one is&nbsp;for you! These boots transform from regular sneakers into ones that are perfect for walking on&nbsp;ice.</p><p>These little spikes will save you from sliding. And they’re gone. To&nbsp;whoever designed this ruler with a&nbsp;raised end&nbsp;— thank you! Looks like picking up&nbsp;the ruler off the table will no&nbsp;longer be&nbsp;a&nbsp;quest. If&nbsp;you have some family members who can’t reach the sink yet, you might want to&nbsp;buy this cool piece of&nbsp;bathroom furniture right about now. Yes, the step pulls out like a&nbsp;drawer! And don’t leave the bathroom just yet&nbsp;— you’re going to&nbsp;love this toilet with a&nbsp;built-in sink.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/190/0d7/522e245867817d42f2c7b418a9.png><p>You wash your hands, and the water will be&nbsp;used for your next flush. Ingenious! Can I&nbsp;interest you in&nbsp;this useful invention? It’s an&nbsp;avocado slicer. You cut your favorite healthy snack in&nbsp;half, seed&nbsp;it, and then scoop out the slices&nbsp;— neat!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpu8SvnKtlmaPDprrTnptmrJikwKZ5yKxkmmWXmruqwdJmb2ptYG1%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dematerialisation-un-mode-unique-de-transmission-pour-les-candidatures-et-les-offres.html><span>←</span><span>un mode unique de transmission pour les candidatures et les offres</span></a>
