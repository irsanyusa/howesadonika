Even though the cases were the main idea behind the series, the <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a> that the characters developed over time won the fans. The Forensic Anthropologist and the special FBI agent stood by&nbsp;their side in&nbsp;sickness and health, in&nbsp;extreme challenges and happy situations during the series, but what are the <a href=# title=Bones data-link=tag>Bones</a> cast doing now? Let’s see.</p><p><h2>1. Dr. Temperance “Bones” Brennan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ad/544/cd886d50338fac4332230ef36a.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e85/ce4/a746a65bada7650e657657395f.jpg><p>Courtesy Everett Collection / East News<span>, </span>Chris Pizzello / Invision / East News</p><p>Emily Deschanel played Dr. Temperance “Bones” Brennan, a&nbsp;forensic anthropologist at&nbsp;the Jeffersonian Institute. Seeley Booth, a&nbsp;specialist FBI agent, is&nbsp;her partner. They collaborate to&nbsp;investigate crimes and solve cases for the FBI. Bones and Booth have had feelings for each other since the first time they laid eyes on&nbsp;each other. In&nbsp;the first season, she begs Booth to&nbsp;look into her parents’ disappearance, which leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;revelation about their background as&nbsp;bank robbers in&nbsp;the second season.</p><p>Brennan realizes her mother is&nbsp;deceased after receiving a&nbsp;recording from her mother on&nbsp;her 16th birthday. Max Keenan, her father, re-enters her life and gradually rebuilds their connection. Despite her best efforts, her feelings for Booth develop, culminating in&nbsp;them becoming a&nbsp;couple. They had a&nbsp;daughter, Christine Angela Booth.</p><p>Deschanel burst to&nbsp;fame as&nbsp;Temperance Brennan on&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series <i>Bones</i>, but she had a&nbsp;long career in&nbsp;television and <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> before that. In&nbsp;the early 2000s, she worked on&nbsp;projects such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rose Red</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Easy</i></a>. Following <i>Bones</i>, she appeared in&nbsp;programs such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Cleveland Show</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>BoJack Horseman</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Simpsons</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Rookie</a>. She starred as&nbsp;Angela Kane in&nbsp;Season 4&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Animal Kingdom</i></a> in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>She most recently portrayed Dr. Suzanne Mathis in&nbsp;Netflix’s miniseries <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Devil in&nbsp;Ohio</i></a> (2022), where she takes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl escaping a&nbsp;cult, causing chaos for her family. She also played the character Nicole in&nbsp;the 2023 <a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Big Boys</i></a><i>.</i> Emily is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>David Hornsby</a> and the couple has two children.</p><p><h2>2. Seeley Booth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19f/df3/46091d5948959af13505e2e771.jpg><p>David Boreanaz is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big name, almost as&nbsp;famous as&nbsp;Emily Deschanel from Bones. He&nbsp;portrayed Brennan’s work partner, special <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agent</a> Seeley Booth. Their team of&nbsp;scientists, or&nbsp;“squints,” became his close allies. Despite not being as&nbsp;academically inclined, he&nbsp;used his instincts to&nbsp;crack cases. Over time, Booth and Brennan grew closer, dealing with personal challenges and dangerous criminals.</p><p>Their relationship saw ups and downs. Booth once arrested Brennan and faced life-threatening situations to&nbsp;protect her. He&nbsp;named his son Parker after a&nbsp;fallen comrade. Booth and Brennan finally became a&nbsp;couple, welcomed their daughter Christine, and later married. Their <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> faced numerous hurdles, including various cases, threats, and professional challenges. However, their unwavering support for each other triumphed in&nbsp;the end.</p><p>Before becoming Seeley Booth on&nbsp;<i>Bones</i>, he&nbsp;was known as&nbsp;Angel, the vampire with a&nbsp;conscience, first in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></a> and then in&nbsp;its spinoff, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Angel</i></a>. He&nbsp;also did a&nbsp;few movies and&nbsp;TV gigs like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mr. Fix It</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mighty Macs</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Full Circle</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sleepy Hollow</i></a>. He&nbsp;even voiced The Green Lantern in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Justice League: The New Frontier</i></a><i>,</i> and made appearances as&nbsp;himself on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Family Guy</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>American Dad</i></a>.</p><p>Since Bones ended, his main gig has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>SEAL Team</i></a>, where he&nbsp;plays Jason Hayes, leading a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;elite Navy SEALs. The show’s been a&nbsp;hit, lasting 5&nbsp;seasons on&nbsp;CBS before moving to&nbsp;Paramount+ for season 6. Now, it’s gearing up&nbsp;for a&nbsp;7th season on&nbsp;the streaming platform. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;married and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has</a> two kids.</p><p><h2>3. Angela Montenegro</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc3/8ae/b387b25d7f8f1b173c3b7689d9.jpg><p>Brennan’s best friend, Angela Montenegro, was portrayed by&nbsp;the one and only Michaela Conlin. She was a&nbsp;pro at&nbsp;reconstructing faces at&nbsp;the Jeffersonian. She has a&nbsp;strong connection with the crew and married Jack Hodgins. Together they have a&nbsp;son. While her background’s a&nbsp;mystery, she’s an&nbsp;artist, a&nbsp;computer wiz, and got her cool name from a&nbsp;<a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a>.</p><p>She’s a&nbsp;fun-loving, free-spirited soul and a&nbsp;key part of&nbsp;the team, balancing their <a href=# title=scientific data-link=tag>scientific</a> minds with her artistic flair. Angela’s pretty open-minded, and socially savvy. She often guides her pals through personal stuff. Her relationship with Hodgins had its ups and downs, including discovering she was technically married to&nbsp;someone else. Angela’s been through a&nbsp;lot emotionally but stays loyal to&nbsp;her friends, even when things get tough.</p><p>Before bringing Angela Montenegro to&nbsp;life on&nbsp;<i>Bones</i>, Michaela Conlin popped up&nbsp;in&nbsp;various&nbsp;TV shows like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>JAG</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The D.A.</i></a>, even landing a&nbsp;lead role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>MDs</i></a>. After Bones, she starred in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Here and Now</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>For All Mankind</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dollface</i></a>. In&nbsp;2018, she was Sarah Nguyen in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Yellowstone</i></a>.</p><p>Her latest work includes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>One True Loves</i></a>, released in&nbsp;April 2023 to&nbsp;mixed reviews. She also had a&nbsp;notable part in&nbsp;Netflix’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bad Trip</i></a>, playing Maria Li&nbsp;alongside Phillipa Soo and Simu Liu.</p><p><h2>4. Jack Hodgins</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01d/323/84752d5167b5b8d8d0d18d89ed.jpg><p>Dr. Jack Hodgins, the quirky <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>forensic</a> entomologist with a&nbsp;knack for conspiracy theories at&nbsp;the Jeffersonian Institute, was portrayed by&nbsp;T.J. Thyne. His character is&nbsp;into bugs, <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a>, and rocks and has a&nbsp;sarcastic streak. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;close friend of&nbsp;Zack Addy and enjoyed doing their crazy experiments together. As&nbsp;the series went&nbsp;on, his character expanded his forensic skills, becoming a&nbsp;crucial part of&nbsp;the show.</p><p>Hodgins comes from serious money but keeps it&nbsp;quiet at&nbsp;work. His family’s loaded, owning a&nbsp;massive company. Despite his wealth, he&nbsp;wants respect for his work, not his cash.</p><p>He&nbsp;faces ups and downs, from losing his fortune to&nbsp;being paralyzed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;explosion. Despite the tough times, he&nbsp;works to&nbsp;regain his mobility and remains dedicated to&nbsp;his job and relationships, especially with Angela. He&nbsp;helps clear Zack’s name after a&nbsp;misunderstanding and even takes charge of&nbsp;the lab for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>Before landing his role on&nbsp;Bones, T.J. Thyne was known for guest appearances on&nbsp;various shows like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Charmed</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Boston Legal</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>CSI: NY</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Without a&nbsp;Trace</i></a>.</p><p>After Bones, Thyne continued guest-starring on&nbsp;series such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Law &&nbsp;Order: Special Victims Unit</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Rookie</i></a>, taking on&nbsp;different one-time roles. In&nbsp;2022, he&nbsp;landed a&nbsp;part as&nbsp;Gordy Willis in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Offer</i></a>, a&nbsp;miniseries delving into the making of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Godfather</i></a> by&nbsp;Francis Ford Coppola.</p><p><h2>5. Dr. Lance Sweets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c00/2a9/2aeeec50e682aea6c1dcc32cde.jpg><p>John Francis Daley <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>portrays</a> Dr. Lance Sweets, an&nbsp;FBI psychologist assigned to&nbsp;Seeley Booth and Temperance Brennan. He&nbsp;offered therapy to&nbsp;the two after their relationship reached difficulties due to&nbsp;Booth’s arrest of&nbsp;Brennan’s father. Despite his youth and mistrust, his psychological insight proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather correct.</p><p>Booth was first skeptical of&nbsp;Sweets’ “mind powers,” but he&nbsp;eventually accepted his advice and sought his assistance during interrogations. Brennan was suspicious about psychology at&nbsp;first but learned to&nbsp;value Sweets’ ideas. He&nbsp;helped solve crimes and consoled people, but his trip ended tragically, leaving a&nbsp;vacuum in&nbsp;the team’s dynamics.</p><p>Daley started in&nbsp;1999&nbsp;as Sam Weir on&nbsp;the beloved&nbsp;TV series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Freaks and Geeks</i></a>. After that show ended, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Waiting...</i></a> and on&nbsp;TV in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Boston Public</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Geena Davis Show</i></a>. He&nbsp;became known for playing Dr. Lance Sweets on&nbsp;<i>Bones</i>, winning fans along the way.</p><p>When his time on&nbsp;Bones wrapped&nbsp;up, Daley decided to&nbsp;explore other opportunities. He&nbsp;directed and had a&nbsp;small role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vacation</i></a>. He&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Game Night</i></a>, but his big accomplishment was writing the screenplay for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a>. While he&nbsp;still acts, Daley’s main focus now is&nbsp;writing and directing with Jonathan Goldstein, like their recent successful film adaptation of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dungeons &&nbsp;Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.</i></a></p><p><h2>6. Dr. Camille Saroyan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/737/87b/a8cf4c572a994f05ad98d97226.jpg><p>Tamara Taylor was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cast</a> for Camile Saroyan, the Forensic Division director at&nbsp;the Jeffersonian Institute. She switched from law enforcement to&nbsp;forensics after being a&nbsp;NYC coroner and officer. She’s a&nbsp;devoted team leader who initially clashed with Dr. Brennan, but later grew close to&nbsp;her and others.</p><p>Her personal life includes a&nbsp;past relationship with Booth that resurfaces briefly, and she shares a&nbsp;strong bond with Booth, Brennan, and Michelle, her ex-fiancé’s daughter. Cam navigates motherhood and eventually marries Arastoo.</p><p>She made a&nbsp;mark with her roles in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Party of&nbsp;Five</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>City of&nbsp;Angels</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hidden Hills</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sex, Love &&nbsp;Secrets</i></a>. However, it&nbsp;was her standout portrayal of&nbsp;Dr. Camille Saroyan in&nbsp;<i>Bones</i> that truly propelled her career, spanning over 200&nbsp;episodes.</p><p>After Bones, Taylor embraced varied roles in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Altered Carbon</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Snowfall</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>October Faction</i></a>. She joined Marvel’s<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i> Agents of&nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D.</i></a> as&nbsp;Sibyl in&nbsp;2020 and portrayed Angela Wheatley in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Law &&nbsp;Order: Organized Crime</i></a> in&nbsp;2021, unraveling ties to&nbsp;a&nbsp;crime kingpin.</p><p><h2>7. James Aubrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d4/bbb/7241395223b95c116629f6508d.jpg><p>When John Francis Daley left Bones, the show needed a&nbsp;new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a> to&nbsp;challenge Seeley Booth. That’s when John Boyd stepped in&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong>James Aubrey</strong>, a&nbsp;witty FBI agent. He’s promoted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-level agent, showing wit, intelligence, and an&nbsp;eccentric personality. He&nbsp;initially focused on&nbsp;cases’ technical sides but learned to&nbsp;see their human impact.</p><p>Boyd was known for his roles in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>24</i></a>&nbsp;and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Argo</i></a>. After <i>Bones</i>, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonderstruck</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Peppermint</i></a> before landing a&nbsp;regular role on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>FBI</i></a> as&nbsp;Agent Stuart Scola, continuing in&nbsp;its spinoff <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>FBI: Most Wanted</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><h2>8. Dr. Zack Addy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/925/acb/f02b74551fb769dc9ce34076f4.jpg><p>Zack Addy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> a&nbsp;forensic anthropologist at&nbsp;the Jeffersonian Institute. He&nbsp;started as&nbsp;Dr. Brennan’s smart assistant and later earned his doctorate in&nbsp;Forensic Anthropology during the show’s second season. Eric Millegan was the actor who breathed life into this character. He&nbsp;specializes, just like Dr. Brennan, in&nbsp;analyzing remains, particularly in&nbsp;figuring out the cause of&nbsp;death and identifying the marks left on&nbsp;skeletal remains.</p><p>Following his portrayal of&nbsp;Dr. Zack Addy on&nbsp;Bones for 64&nbsp;episodes, Eric Millegan hasn’t pursued any other acting roles since the show concluded. Despite his impactful performance on&nbsp;Bones, he&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;have shifted his focus away from acting following the series’ end. Before that, he&nbsp;played the role of&nbsp;Jerry in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lady Peacock</i></a><i>, </i>Reed Jenkins in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Phobic</i></a><i>,</i> Ed&nbsp;Simone in<i>&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>On&nbsp;Line</i></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>,</i></a><i> </i>and several other smaller roles. On&nbsp;his <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, he&nbsp;shares that he&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sing</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Millegan is&nbsp;gay and was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>named</a> the “Hottest Up-and-Coming Openly Gay Actor of&nbsp;2003” by&nbsp;<i>Out</i> magazine. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> his longtime partner, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charles Michel</a>, in&nbsp;2012.</p><p><h2>9. Daisy Wick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b2/b96/f4d6055402b32abc8b0241cea5.jpg><p>Carla Gallo got the role of&nbsp;Daisy Wick in&nbsp;the series. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Bones cast, she was really honest and dedicated, but often got on&nbsp;people’s nerves because she blurted out whatever she thought. She had a&nbsp;relationship with Lance Sweets, and they even got engaged, but they later broke&nbsp;up. They ended up&nbsp;having a&nbsp;son together, Seeley Lance, before Sweets passed away tragically, leaving Daisy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother.</p><p>After Bones ended in&nbsp;2017, Gallo hasn’t acted much, focusing on&nbsp;her family instead. She had her second child with her partner, now husband, screenwriter Mark Satterthwaite. Despite this, she appeared in&nbsp;the Netflix film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Little Evil</i></a>, and portrayed a&nbsp;real film executive in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Stupid and Futile Gesture</i></a>.</p><p><h2>10. Max Keenan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/222/f5c/a2354d5d8aa35ea2487eceb514.jpg><p>Max Keenan was Brennan’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>father</a>. He&nbsp;and his wife were career criminals who hid after committing numerous crimes. They changed their identities to&nbsp;protect their kids from their criminal past. Max appeared in&nbsp;Brennan’s life several times, even faking as&nbsp;a&nbsp;priest. Eventually, he&nbsp;died while defending his grandchildren.</p><p>Sadly, Ryan O’Neal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed</a> away in&nbsp;December 2023, ending his career with Max Keenan being his last role.</p><p><h2>11. Caroline Julian</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98c/2b6/a312aa577ca5862bdaa6f82d86.jpg><p>Caroline Julian, is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>smart</a> and demanding, often showing a&nbsp;no-nonsense attitude, even with Brennan. She’s skilled in&nbsp;legal matters and has a&nbsp;<a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> with Booth, trusting his instincts on&nbsp;cases. Caroline played a&nbsp;key role in&nbsp;court and in&nbsp;solving cases, sometimes clashing with Brennan over parole and legal strategies. Despite her tough exterior, she’s deeply invested in&nbsp;causes like education for inner-city communities.</p><p>Patricia Belcher portrayed federal prosecutor Caroline Julian throughout the series.
