However, buying a pillow feels like an even bigger pain in the neck, because there are thousands of options to filter through, and they all start to look the same after a few scrolls. If you’re caught between wanting the softness of down pillows (or down alternative pillows) but with a bit more support, consider a memory foam pillow. These take other <a rel=alternate href=#>types of pillows</a> up a notch as they are typically cloud-like, but nuanced with regard to their level of firmness.</p><p>“Pillows, like mattresses and shoewear, are very personal, which means there is usually a required period of experimentation to determine which type of pillow works best for your body and any pain symptoms you might be experiencing,” says Dr. Tom Walters, DPT, OCS and author of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Rehab Science: How to Overcome Pain and Heal from Injury</a>. To find the best memory foam pillows on the market, we spoke to Dr. Walters, but also a few other experts: Dr. Craig Steineman, PT, DPT, CSCS, Orthopedic Physical Therapist at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Corewell Health Physical Therapy</a>, Katie Elks, design director at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklinen</a>, and Byron Golub, vice president of product and merchandising at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saatva</a>. Whether you’re wondering about the differences between solid and shredded fill, or want to know the coolest option, here’s everything you need to know about finding the <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a> for your needs.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-memory-foam-pillow>What to consider when choosing a memory foam pillow</h2><h3>Foam fill type</h3><p>Although all memory foam pillows are made with memory foam, a pillow’s specific construction may consist of one piece or multiple shredded pieces. According to Golub, people who sleep in one position are more likely to benefit from a one-piece pillow whereas people who frequently change positions are more apt to gravitate towards pillows with shredded fill.</p><h3>Pillow size</h3><p>Paying attention to a pillow’s size when shopping for a memory foam pillow is important, as a pillow’s size can have an impact on its comfortability and level of support. “Size should be selected based on body size,” explains Steineman. “A person with a larger frame will generally need a larger pillow because the space between one’s head/neck and the bed that needs to be filled to achieve a neutral spine will be larger.”</p><h3>Trial period</h3><p>Shopping for a pillow is a personalized experience since everyone sleeps differently and has different preferences and needs. Considering memory pillows from brands offering trail periods is important so you can see if the pillow works to provide you with the best possible sleep. “Several companies will allow you to use their pillow for a certain period of time (up to 100 days in some cases) and return it for a full refund if it isn't doesn't work for your situation,” explains Walters. “Because pillow choice and how it affects your body is so individual, it's a good idea to work with a company that allows you to test their product before making a long-term commitment.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-memory-foam-pillows>Our top picks for the best memory foam pillows</h2><h3>Most comfortable memory foam pillow: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Company Store Dual Memory Foam and Gel Fiber Pillow</a></h3><p>This dual-sided pillow from The Company Store is a champion when it comes to comfort.

Additionally, we conducted online research on a variety of brands to find their best memory foam pillows by examining product information and customer reviews.</p><h2 id=who-is-best-suited-to-use-a-memory-foam-pillow>Who is best suited to use a memory foam pillow?</h2><p>Although nearly any sleeper could use a memory foam pillow, “memory foam pillows are best for people who regularly experience neck/shoulder region discomfort when sleeping or people who simply have a hard time finding a pillow that feels like the right firmness,” explains Walters. “Because these pillows often can be customized in terms of density and firmness, they are a great option for people who find themselves in these scenarios.”</p><h2 id=which-memory-foam-pillow-sizes-are-available->Which memory foam pillow sizes are available?</h2><p>According to Walters, standard/queen and king are the typical memory foam pillow sizes.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs->Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How long does a memory foam pillow last?</h3><p>Although the duration of a memory foam pillow varies by brand, “memory foam pillows will last from three to five years in most cases,” explains Walters. Though the question on <a rel=alternate href=#>how often should you replace pillows </a>can lead to a number of different answers, you’ll know when it’s time for you to replace your current one with a new one when it begins to lose its shape. Furthermore, "if your pillow has an unusual smell, causes sneezing, appears discolored and lumpy, lacks resilience, or causes neck pain regularly, these are signs that it's probably time to purchase a new one,” adds Golub.</p><h3>Are memory foam pillows adjustable?</h3><p>According to Elks, many memory foam pillows are adjustable by way of adding and removing filling to create a desired firmness. However, some can be adjusted using zippers.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of a memory foam pillow?</h3><p>When it comes to memory foam pillows, the advantages significantly outweigh the disadvantages. Despite that, memory foam pillows tend to be more expensive than non-memory foam pillows. “They can range from $40-$199 depending on the brand,” says Walters. Additionally, it can be increasingly difficult to keep a memory foam pillow clean since memory foam can’t usually be machine washed. “Use a pillowcase and a pillow protector to help keep your pillow in tip-top shape,” Elks advises.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnZq6sL7YZp2omZ1ivaq4y6iurGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-dining-table.html><span>←</span><span>Best Dining Table : 10 Picks for Any Budget and Room Size</span></a>
