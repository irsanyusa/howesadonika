Over the course of two decades, Affleck and Lopez’s relationship has touched on nearly every storyline of a Hollywood romance, from their flashy early courtship<strong> </strong>and messy breakup to their fairy-tale reconciliation and eventual marriage. The public fascination with their relationship has inspired everything from a South Park episode to the creation of a joint moniker (hello, Bennifer!), making the duo a cultural touchstone in the process.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Which might explain why Lopez (and a seemingly<strong> </strong>begrudging but loving Affleck) decided to tell the story of their relationship in a recent documentary, The Greatest Love Story Never Told. The film, streaming on<strong> </strong>Amazon Prime and drawing its name from a description of their romance in one of the real-life love letters Affleck wrote Lopez, is ostensibly about the making of her bombastic musical movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This Is Me…Now</a> and its accompanying album, released in February. But really, it sets out to make the case that Bennifer might be one of the greatest love stories of our time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Jennifer Lopez Remains the Patron Saint of Romantic Comedies</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like This Is Me…Now, The Greatest Love Story Never Told can be bewildering in its ambition and chaotic in its storytelling, but there was one scene that shocked me into seriously examining the epic romance between Affleck and Lopez. Early on in the documentary, Lopez shares with her team the Christmas gift that Affleck gave to her in 2021, an extensive scrapbook chronicling every picture, email and letter the two have shared since they first met in 2001. The moment itself, though casual, is breathtaking when you realize that Affleck, a two-time Oscar winner so known for his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly downtrodden stoicism that he inspired a meme</a>, retrieved every piece of correspondence with a woman he fell in love with over 20 years ago, then presented it all to her when they reunited two decades later. Perhaps even more astounding is that Lopez uses this as the jumping-off point for her new album and film, basically offering the most private and vulnerable part of a highly public relationship for her art.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The couple met in 2001 on the set of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the objectively bad film Gigli</a>, where their workplace romance grew into one of the most emblematic celebrity couplings of the era—Lopez, a pop star and rom-com golden girl from the Bronx and Affleck, the Oscar-winning bad boy from Boston. Their relationship blossomed under the watchful eye of the tabloids, and in spite of it, solidifying them as true A-listers whose personal lives were as compelling as their work on-screen. While cynics may have pointed to the high-profile pairing as a ploy to boost their celebrity, Lopez and Affleck’s displays of affection came off as pure romance, authentic if outsized. How else to explain Affleck taking out full-page ads in trade rags to congratulate Lopez after she won an award,<strong> </strong>or Lopez penning a love song on her 2002 album This Is Me…Then, titled, “Dear Ben,” and dedicating the entire album to him? Or what about Affleck proposing to Lopez, after just over a year of dating, with a 6.1 carat pink diamond from Harry Winston? Their whirlwind romance was fantastical, heady, even giddy, the equivalent of watching a rom-com in real time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 16 Best J. Lo Movies Of All Time</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez famously poked fun of the relentless media scrutiny around Bennifer in her 2002 music video for “Jenny from the Block,” in which Affleck cameoed as himself, notoriously kissing her bikini-clad posterior on a yacht, as the paparazzi swarmed<strong>. </strong>But in real life, it led to the couple postponing their wedding in September 2003, just three days before their planned nuptials. “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date," they said in a statement. "When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate 'decoy brides' at three different locations, we realized that something was awry.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The pair broke up in early 2004, before swiftly jumping into new relationships—Lopez married singer Marc Anthony in June 2004, while Affleck wed actor Jennifer Garner in June 2005. Over the next two decades, they both welcomed children, went through divorces, and weathered undue media scrutiny. This came for things as insignificant as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a back tattoo</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking while looking disinterested</a>, and as sobering as a rumored cheating scandal (Affleck's divorce from Garner came on the heels of <a href=#>an alleged affair</a> with their one-time nanny, Christine Ouzonian; Affleck denied any romantic or sexual relationship with her)<strong> </strong>and the breaking of an engagement (Lopez called off her engagement to baseball star Alex Rodriguez <a href=#>amid reports of his infidelity</a>). They lived, arguably, an entire lifetime without each other before they gloriously, miraculously, reentered each other’s lives in mid-2021, <a href=#>in the ultimate pandemic reconnection with an ex</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>A Guide to All the Cameos in Jennifer Lopez’s Star-Studded This Is Me…Now: A Love Story</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once again, their romance captivated like a real-life rom-com, providing endless thrills to those watching while socially distancing at home as Lopez went Instagram official with Affleck by posting photos of the couple on a yacht for her birthday that summer, seemingly recreating their scenes from “Jenny from the Block.” Like its OG counterpart, Bennifer 2.0 has had no shortage of delights, from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">corny couples Dunkin’ Donuts commercials</a> and gushing interviews to its very whirlwind nature—the pair were engaged by April 2022 before getting married not just once, but twice. While their rekindled romance has given us many things, This Is Me…Now and The Greatest Love Story Never Told among them, it’s been a reminder that as long as Bennifer is in this world, romance is alive and well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, a comprehensive look back at Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s relationship history.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">December 2001: Affleck and Lopez meet on the set of Gigli</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1717360.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Lopez and Affleck said they had been at parties together in the past, they didn’t formally meet until they began working together on the set of the romantic comedy Gigli. Affleck played the titular role of Larry Gigli, an L.A. mobster who hires Ricki, a hit-woman, played by Lopez.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a 2003 interview with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Affleck says that while he and Lopez connected quickly on the set of Gigli, it was entirely platonic because she was married at the time. In the fall of 2001, Lopez married Chris Judd, one of the back-up dancers in her "Love Don't Cost a Thing" music video.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When I met her, we became really, really, really good friends,” he said. “But at first, because she was married, there was no thought of a romantic relationship, so that created the opportunity to get to know each other without any of the falseness that goes with courtship because you're trying to make a good impression."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">March 2002: Affleck places full-page ads in trade publications in support of Lopez</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After Lopez was named ShoWest's Female Star of the Year, Affleck took out full-page ads in the Hollywood Reporter and Variety in support of her. While Affleck claimed that his ads for Lopez were written to counteract narratives that she was a diva or difficult to work with, his glowing message to her piqued interest in their relationship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You have shown kindness, dedication, diligence, humility, graciousness of spirit, beauty in courage, great empathy, astonishing talent, real poise and true grace,” he <a href=#>wrote</a>. “It has been nothing but an honor and a pleasure to work with you. I only wish I were lucky enough to be in all your movies. With love, respect and gratitude, Ben Affleck.''</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">July 2002: Lopez divorces husband Cris Judd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jennifer-Lopez-Cris-Judd.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez divorced Judd after nine months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Judd was her second husband (she was previously married to actor Ojani Noa).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Affleck emphasized in his <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> interview that he didn’t think about Lopez romantically when they met, he said things changed after she told him that she was splitting from her husband.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It changed when she told me she was getting separated," Affleck said. "At that point, it became a possibility; doors were opened."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2002: Affleck and Lopez star in her music video for “Jenny from the Block”</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For her music video for “Jenny from the Block,” a single off her then upcoming album, This Is Me…Then, Lopez and Affleck appeared as versions of themselves, trying to escape the paparazzi. The video used imaginary surveillance footage, as well as shots of the couple on a yacht, by the pool, and eating outside at a restaurant to seemingly critique the relentless media scrutiny the pair experienced.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2002: Affleck and Lopez begin filming Jersey Girl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jersey-Girl-Ben-Aflleck-Jennifer-Lopez.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That same month, Affleck and Lopez began filming their second film together, Jersey Girl, in which they appear as a husband and wife.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2002: Affleck and Lopez confirm their engagement</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a Prime Time interview with Diane Sawyer, Lopez confirmed their engagement, which many had speculated about after she was spotted<strong> </strong>wearing a 6 carat pink diamond Harry Winston ring on her ring finger. According to Lopez, the proposal took place during a private moment in Affleck’s hometown of Boston.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It's just a blanket, a quilt of rose petals, all over the whole entire house," Lopez said, noting that the engagement also included Affleck reading a handwritten letter listing the reasons why he loved her. "So many candles, and vases, bouquets. And my song 'Glad' was playing...I walk in and I was just overwhelmed. I wasn't expecting it, and I was just like 'Oh my God.'"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Nov. 26, 2002: Lopez releases This Is Me…Then</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez’s third studio album, This Is Me…Then, was largely inspired by her relationship with Affleck, which was blossoming as she was writing and recording the project. The influence of their romance on her work may be most overtly seen in her song “Dear Ben,” a musical love letter to Affleck, which includes the lyrics: “I write this song to let you know/ That you will always be to me/ My lust, my love, my man/ my child, my friend, and my king.” Lopez also dedicated the album to him, the only time she has done this to date for a romantic partner.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">March 2003: Affleck says that Lopez is the only person who made him want a family</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a cover story with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Affleck speaks at length about his relationship with Lopez, being especially candid about wanting to start a family with her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Jen and I want to get married for the reason everyone else does: we fell in love,” he said. “I'm in love; I want to have a family; and she's the only person I've ever met who made me entertain the thought of doing that. You know within 10 minutes of meeting Jen that she'll be a good mother. Though the heavens fall, she'll be a good mother.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Aug. 1, 2003: Gigli releases in theaters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Gigli-Jennifer-Lopez-Ben-Affleck.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gigli releases to almost universally negative reviews, panned by critics and moviegoers alike. Dubbed the “worst movie” of the century by the Wall Street Journal, the critique leveled at the movie resulted in even greater media scrutiny on Lopez and Affleck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a 2015 interview with <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a>, Lopez said that Gigli’s release was the start of a difficult period in her life. “I think the worst, probably lowest point was the whole Gigli era. It was pretty tough," she said. "It was a very badly reviewed film. I was in a high-profile relationship at the time that fell apart in a really bad way, and so the kind of mix of those two things and the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment. I was in the tabloids every other week about how my life was falling apart. It was a tough time."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">September 2003: Lopez and Affleck postpone their wedding</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Three days ahead of their wedding, Lopez and Affleck postponed tying the knot in Santa Barbara because of the media frenzy surrounding the event. In a statement to <a href=#>People</a>, the couple addressed their reasons for calling off the wedding.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,” Affleck and Lopez said in a statement. “When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ‘decoy brides’ at three different locations, we realized that something was awry. We began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised. We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">January 2004: Lopez and Affleck confirm their breakup</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After 18 months together, Lopez and Affleck officially announced their breakup. Lopez issued<a href=#> a statement</a> about the split: “Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck. At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.” Affleck’s publicist refused to confirm anything about the actor’s personal life in response, saying, “It’s not happening from our side.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">March 2004: Jersey Girl releases in theaters</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jersey Girl releases in theaters to lukewarm reviews.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">June 5, 2004: Lopez marries Marc Anthony</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jennifer-Lopez-Marc-Anthony.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Four months after confirming her split with Affleck, Lopez marries singer Marc Anthony at her home in Beverly Hills. Lopez and Anthony met in 1998, while he was starring on Broadway in The Capeman; in her 2014 memoir, True Love, Lopez said that Anthony told her at their first meeting: "One day you’re going to be my wife."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the memoir, Lopez also revealed that the relationship came about because she "sought out comfort in another person," following her split from Affleck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Marc came back into my life three days after I should have been at the altar saying 'I do' to another man," she wrote.
