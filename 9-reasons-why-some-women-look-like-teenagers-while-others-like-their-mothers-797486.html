1. High-cheekbones beauty trend
Since the cheekbones that remind of&nbsp;the fashion models from the 1990s came back in&nbsp;style, many women started to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;their Buccal fat pads (they’re fat masses in&nbsp;cheeks)."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We’ll talk about them in&nbsp;our article.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> found out what may be&nbsp;“stealing” our youth.</p><p><h2>1. High-cheekbones beauty trend</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/632/5d0/dbd7ad5428b55145cca8cb6eb5.jpg><p>Since the cheekbones that remind of&nbsp;the fashion models from the 1990s came back in&nbsp;style, many women started to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;their <a href=#>Buccal fat pads</a> (they’re fat masses in&nbsp;cheeks). The surgery itself isn’t very complicated, and patients get it&nbsp;under local anesthesia&nbsp;— a&nbsp;surgeon makes incisions on&nbsp;the insides of&nbsp;the cheeks and removes the fat pads. This seemingly banal procedure may have serious consequences, and <a href=# title="plastic surgeons" data-link=tag>plastic surgeons</a> <a href=#>don’t recommend</a> that patients with narrow faces undergo&nbsp;it, because <strong>a&nbsp;face that lacks a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;its natural structural frame may end up&nbsp;looking haggard and exhausted in&nbsp;the long run.</strong></p><p>Of&nbsp;course, naturally defined cheekbones look beautiful, but only if&nbsp;they’re a&nbsp;genetic gift from our parents and not the result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;surgical change of&nbsp;the facial structure. It’s important to&nbsp;remember that the consequences of&nbsp;this procedure are irreversible, so&nbsp;it’s probably easier to&nbsp;love your chubby cheeks than to&nbsp;pay tribute to&nbsp;fashion and regret the consequences in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>2. Doing too many salon beauty procedures</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf9/42b/3c91f658b487ecac696b5b26be.jpg><p>You’ve probably noticed that the skin of&nbsp;the women who overdo it&nbsp;with salon procedures and peels<a href=#> becomes</a> unnaturally smooth with age, which can remind&nbsp;us of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wax doll. It&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;premature aging&nbsp;— the skin will become thin and flabby, and visible capillaries and wrinkles will appear.</p><p>Women’s passion for another popular procedure, Botox injections, may be&nbsp;revealed by&nbsp;the specific skin shine and flat forehead that is&nbsp;the <a href=#>result</a> of&nbsp;muscle atrophy. It&nbsp;can <a href=#>lead</a> to&nbsp;the loss of&nbsp;natural facial volumes, making the skin look older. And <strong>regular facial modeling, with the help of&nbsp;fillers,</strong> <a href=#>distorts</a> the natural face anatomy and visually adds extra years. The side effects of&nbsp;these procedures are especially visible on&nbsp;people who are younger than 35&nbsp;years old.</p><p><strong>The conclusion: </strong>Beauticians and plastic surgeons have difficulties working with patients whose faces have been transformed by&nbsp;surgery and injections many times. So&nbsp;the later in&nbsp;life a&nbsp;woman starts undergoing “adult” procedures, the longer she’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;look natural and young.</p><p><h2>3. Harsh diets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/170/9e5/d8170a5abba2f9a62dbf2caa4a.jpg><p>The more weight a&nbsp;person loses, the more chances that <a href=#>“diet face”</a> may appear. Because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;fat, the nasolabial lines become more visible, wrinkles become deeper, and the lack of&nbsp;volume around the eyes makes the face look tired and older.</p><p><strong>After a&nbsp;person turns&nbsp;40, it’s better to&nbsp;ditch the desire to&nbsp;lose too much weight </strong>or&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;the weight you were as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager. A&nbsp;<a href=#>study </a>that was conducted on&nbsp;twins suggests that if&nbsp;a&nbsp;person’s body mass index becomes 4&nbsp;points higher, a&nbsp;person under 40&nbsp;looks older, but a&nbsp;person over 40&nbsp;— younger. And after a&nbsp;person becomes older than&nbsp;55, they can gain 8&nbsp;more points on&nbsp;the scale of&nbsp;the body mass index and still look younger than their peers who stick to&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict diet.</p><p><h2>4. Too little or&nbsp;too much physical activity</h2></p><p>An&nbsp;active lifestyle not only enhances health, but also prolongs youth. And this fact is&nbsp;backed up&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> that suggests that older people who exercise regularly don’t just <strong>slow down the aging process</strong>, but they have the immunity and the cholesterol levels that may be&nbsp;comparable to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;young people.</p><p>But it’s important to&nbsp;set healthy limits, because another extreme of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sedentary lifestyle is&nbsp;excessive physical activity, which may bring more <a href=#>harm</a> than good. Tracy Mountford, the director of&nbsp;the cosmetic clinic in&nbsp;London, <a href=#>noted</a> that after the age of&nbsp;40, the loss of&nbsp;facial volume may be&nbsp;accelerated because of&nbsp;the intensive workouts, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, a&nbsp;person may look way older than they really are.</p><p><h2>5. “Sugar” face</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5f/539/50dc3a58bc819a98368ea8030d.jpg><p>A&nbsp;dull skin tone, inflammation, sagging skin, bags under the eyes, and wrinkles on&nbsp;the forehead are the cost of&nbsp;a&nbsp;love for sweets. Sugar <a href=#>promotes</a> glycation&nbsp;— a&nbsp;process where the excess glucose damages collagen and makes it&nbsp;inelastic, which <strong>speeds up&nbsp;the skin’s aging</strong>.</p><p><h2>6. Sleeping on&nbsp;your side or&nbsp;on&nbsp;your stomach</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/1b5/ba4/0278615147a66ddf5ed36abdc8.jpeg><p>Scientists have <a href=#>figured out</a> that <strong>people who sleep poorly age quicker</strong>. 60&nbsp;women from age 30&nbsp;to&nbsp;49&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;study, and it&nbsp;showed that sleep-deprived women experience signs of&nbsp;skin aging, like wrinkles, pigmentation, and lack of&nbsp;elasticity. Their skin also became more sensitive to&nbsp;environmental factors and its ability to&nbsp;restore after it&nbsp;was exposed to&nbsp;the sun became lower.</p><p>According to&nbsp;another <a href=#>study</a>, the way we&nbsp;sleep is&nbsp;also important. A&nbsp;person changes their body position about 20&nbsp;times per night. In&nbsp;65% of&nbsp;cases, people sleep on&nbsp;their side, and this contributes to&nbsp;the formation of&nbsp;wrinkles on&nbsp;the face and neck. With age, a&nbsp;person changes their sleeping position less often&nbsp;— the number drops from 27&nbsp;to&nbsp;16&nbsp;times per night. And the longer a&nbsp;person stays in&nbsp;the same position, the longer their skin has to&nbsp;deal with the adverse effects.</p><p><h2>7. Divorce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/335/1fe/25a7515286a8b46eecbc33d58c.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> that was conducted by&nbsp;plastic surgeons, divorce may leave its mark on&nbsp;the face. Twins participated in&nbsp;this study, and the results showed that <strong>people who went through a&nbsp;divorce looked almost 2&nbsp;years older</strong> than their siblings who were married, single, or&nbsp;even widowed.</p><p><h2>8. Antidepressant medications</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c8/8d2/508d1656f1b41f530fc6b1afc1.jpg><p>Stress also influenced the visual perception of&nbsp;twins from the experiment mentioned in&nbsp;the previous point. The researchers <a href=#>believe</a> that <strong>muscle relaxation caused by&nbsp;antidepressants</strong> may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for skin sagging.</p><p><h2>9. Fuzzy philtrum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25b/045/b10cd55f4598a9c1b74e0b23b8.jpg><p>The <a href=#>philtrum</a> is&nbsp;the small area between the base of&nbsp;the nose and the Cupid’s bow, and it’s an&nbsp;important element of&nbsp;the facial structure. In&nbsp;young people, this area looks very defined, but with age, it&nbsp;becomes flat in&nbsp;most people. But<strong> it’s possible to&nbsp;make the face look younger with the help of&nbsp;beauty products</strong>&nbsp;— apply a&nbsp;dark contouring product to&nbsp;the philtrum to&nbsp;create shade and then apply some highlighter above your upper lip.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you look younger or&nbsp;older than your peers?
