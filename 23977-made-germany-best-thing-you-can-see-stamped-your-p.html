The survey asked people in 23 countries whether they would think more or less positively about a product if it was made in one of 12 nations.</p><p>Across the 23 countries an average of 50% of people would think more positively about a product if they saw “made in Germany” written on it. By contrast, only 6% on average would think worse of the product for seeing its place of origin, giving products made in Germany an average net score of +45 and the top spot on the list.</p><p>When it comes to British goods, on average 41% of people across all countries think positively of them and only 6% negatively, giving a net score of -34 (tying in third place with France).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Made20in20net20scores-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Japanese goods are seen as superior to those of regional rival South Korea. While Japanese products have a net score of +33 (with 45% holding a positive view compared to 11% a negative one), in South Korea this figure is only +5 (26% positive, 21% negative).</p><p>By contrast, an average of 44% of people have a more negative view of a product upon seeing that it was made in China, almost three times the number who would think more positively of a Chinese product (15%). This gives Chinese products a net score of -29, the lowest of the 12 nationalities we asked about.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, most products receive a ‘home team advantage’, being more positively reviewed by those in its country of origin. Nowhere is this more the case than Mexico, where 67% feel warmer towards anything “hecho en Mexico”, compared to an average of 17% across the 23 countries.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Made20in20home20team20advantage-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The most muted home team advantage is in Germany. That is not to say that Germans are not proud of their products – 59% have a more positive view of something made in their country, compared to the 23-country average of 50%. It is rather that there is such extraordinary enthusiasm for German goods in other countries (as high as 77% in Egypt) that it makes the Germans seem less enthusiastic by comparison.</p><p>The least likely to hold a positive view of their own national products are the Chinese, with fewer than half (46%) saying they thought more highly of a product upon finding it was manufactured domestically.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktq%2FAxKulmqyZpLuiuI6aqa2hk6GytHuRbHBwb12irqWxjKCcq6WRo8ZursSsq2asmJ67qHnYqKxmm5GjerSxxGaqrZmdpbKlediorKtloA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./le-comite-des-regions-veut-bannir-les-sacs-plastiques-dici-2020.html><span>←</span><span>Le Comit des rgions veut bannir les sacs plastiques d'ici 2020</span></a>
