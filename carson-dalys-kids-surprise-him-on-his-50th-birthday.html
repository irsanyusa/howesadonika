That’s when his co-host Savannah Guthrie announced that his three daughters were there to surprise him.</p><p>Etta, 10, London, 8, and Goldie, 3, appeared on the set to wheel in a cake for their dad. In a cute moment, Goldie ran up to Daly with an ice cream cone in her hand, and he picked her up.</p><p>The only person missing was Daly’s 14-year-old son Jackson, who opted to sleep in. Daly joked of the teenager, “He asked how much the appearance fee was to show up this morning.”</p><p>Daly’s family and co-hosts (as well as guest Kelly Clarkson) then joined in to sing “Happy Birthday” to him. Clarkson even chimed in during the song to say, “Hashtag you’re old.”</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>BLAKE SHELTON, CARSON DALY TALK ABOUT THEIR BROMANCE: “WE CAN’T BE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER”</strong></a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daly-says-i-feel-better-now-than-in-his-20s>Daly Says ‘I Feel Better Now’ Than in His 20s</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Today.com</a>, Daly reflected on turning 50, saying, “I feel better now than I did in my 20s.” When he was younger, he struggled with generalized anxiety disorder, saying he “couldn’t relax.”</p><p>“I now have the tools to work through my anxiety,” said Daly, who underwent cognitive behavioral therapy. “I’ve never felt this strong mentally, and that’s one of the reasons I feel so good about going into my 50s.”</p><p>Daly even has a room in his house devoted to mental health that his family calls the “Daly Health and Wellness Center,” which has a Peloton bike and a cold plunge pool. He said he’s “living in the moment and taking advantage of each day.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_KellyClarkson_Theo-WargoGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Kelly Clarkson’s New Album ‘Chemistry’ Is Topping the Charts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carson daly</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqprKeeYrGiuNisZKShlKh6tMHRqamiq5Vitaq5jKilZqCZqHp2fNOhZJuhoqm1pa3YaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lapproche-du-projet-de-loi-bachelot-lapvf-publie-son-troisieme-livre-blanc.html><span>←</span><span>A l'approche du projet de loi Bachelot, l'APVF publie son troisime livre blanc</span></a>
